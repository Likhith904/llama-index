# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

Ayurveda is considered the mother of all healing systems, with its roots in ancient Indian texts and practices. It encompasses various branches such as pediatrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, surgery, and more. These branches have influenced modern medicine and healing modalities like massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture.

## The Wisdom of Charaka

Charaka, a renowned sage-physician and one of the founders of Ayurvedic medicine, emphasized the importance of approaching patients with love and light. He believed that true healing comes from a place of compassion and understanding.

### A Message of Love

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

The five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth - form the basis of material creation and are present in all matter, including the human body.

### Space (Ether):

Space is universal, formless, and all-pervading. It is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. Psychologically, space provides freedom and peace but can also lead to feelings of emptiness and insecurity.

### Ayurvedic Remedies:

For remedies related to specific illnesses and imbalances, refer to the comprehensive A-Z guide provided in this book.

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three primary doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific elements and governs various bodily functions.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with fire and water elements. It governs metabolism and digestion, as well as emotions and intellect.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha combines water and earth elements. It provides structure and stability to the body, as well as lubrication and immunity.

## Imbalance and Remedies

When a dosha is out of balance, it can lead to various physical and emotional ailments. Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal treatments.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This comprehensive guide provides information on a wide range of illnesses and their corresponding ayurvedic remedies. From common colds to chronic conditions, Ayurveda offers natural solutions for healing.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of balancing the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and well-being. Understanding the qualities associated with each dosha is crucial in identifying imbalances and restoring harmony.

## Qualities of Doshas:

- Vata: Associated with dryness, constipation, emaciation, and irregularity.
- Pitta: Linked to heat, burning sensations, inflammation, and irritability.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, lethargy, congestion, and excess mucus.

Ayurvedic treatment involves aligning lifestyle choices with your unique constitution to promote balance and health. Self-awareness, observation, and a willingness to act on your knowledge are key factors in achieving optimal well-being.

The remedies provided in this book are designed to assist you in restoring balance and vitality. By making conscious choices in diet, exercise, and daily routines, you can support your body's natural healing processes and enhance overall health.

Remember, small adjustments in your daily habits can have a significant impact on your well-being. Listen to your body, honor its needs, and cultivate a lifestyle that nurtures harmony and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of mind, body, and spirit to prevent and treat illnesses.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics that influence an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

### Vata Dosha

One of the main psychological qualities of vata individuals is readiness to change. They are often restless, quick-thinking, and creative. However, they may also experience instability and lack of grounding. Vata types tend to have dry skin, light body frames, and cold hands and feet.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are known for their intense focus, determination, and strong digestion. They can be competitive and ambitious, but may also be prone to anger and irritability when out of balance. Pitta types typically have a medium build, sharp intellect, and warm body temperature.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha types are characterized by their calm and nurturing nature. They are often patient, loving, and compassionate. However, they can also be prone to lethargy and weight gain when imbalanced. Kapha individuals usually have strong, sturdy builds, smooth skin, and a tendency towards sluggish digestion.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include rough skin, cracking joints, anxiety, restlessness, and dry throat. Excess vata can lead to symptoms like bloating, insomnia, and insecurity.
- Pitta: Characteristics include sharp intellect, strong digestion, and tendency towards anger and inflammation. Excess pitta can manifest as heartburn, skin rashes, and irritability.
- Kapha: Characteristics include stability, calmness, and tendency towards lethargy and weight gain. Excess kapha can result in congestion, weight gain, and attachment.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Excess vata is a major factor in PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Symptoms of aggravated vata include bloating, low back ache, anxiety, and insomnia. To balance vata, individuals should stick to a routine, dress warmly, and consume warm, moist foods.

### General Guidelines for Balancing Vata

- Keep warm
- Keep calm
- Avoid raw foods
- Avoid cold foods
- Avoid extreme cold temperatures
- Eat warm foods and spices
- Keep a regular routine

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

### LIKE INCREASES LIKE

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

## Seasons

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Governs movement, creativity, and communication.
- Pitta: Governs digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governs stability, strength, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Deposition or Infiltration

The aggravated dosha enters weak or defective organs or tissues, leading to pathological changes. Factors like trauma, genetic predisposition, and emotional stress can contribute to this.

### Manifestation

In this stage, signs and symptoms of the disease become apparent, and the person falls sick. Disease manifests in the area of the defective tissue.

### Cellular Deformity Leading to Structural Distortion

At this stage, the disease is fully developed, and structural changes occur. Complications may arise in other organs or tissues.

For more detailed information on cleansing and purification techniques, refer to chapter 4 of the book.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent disease.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues
6. Destruction (Bheda): Manifestation of signs and symptoms

Awareness and prevention play a key role in maintaining health according to Ayurveda. By understanding one's constitution and making mindful choices in diet and lifestyle, one can prevent the abnormal movement of doshas and promote normal functioning.

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

One of the key treatments in Ayurveda is Panchakarma, a five-procedure program aimed at detoxifying the body. The program includes preparatory methods like internal oleation with ghee, external oleation with oil massage and sweating, and specific actions to eliminate excess doshas and toxins.

Some of the procedures involved in Panchakarma include therapeutic vomiting (vamana), purgation or laxative therapy (virechana), medicated enema therapy (basti), nasal administration of medication (nasya), and purification of the blood (rakta moksha).

Ayurveda also offers other methods to remove toxins from the body based on the individual's strength and the severity of the disease.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls metabolism and digestion. An excess of Pitta can result in inflammation, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Influenced by the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs stability and structure. Imbalance in Kapha may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Panchakarma: A powerful cleansing procedure in Ayurveda that is tailored to each individual's constitution and medical condition. It requires close supervision and post-treatment support.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, constipation, and insomnia.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and indigestion.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may cause congestion, lethargy, and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Home remedies in Ayurveda aim not only to treat the symptoms but also to purify the body and prevent future diseases. Rejuvenation and rebuilding are essential aspects of Ayurvedic healing.

### Schedule for Home Panchakarma

Here is an ideal schedule for your home panchakarma purification treatment:

|Day|Internal|External|Oil Bath|Basti|Your Doshic Diet|Diet|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Monday|Monodiet Kitchari|Kitchari with steamed vegetables|Coriander/cumin/fennel tea| | | |

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism. It is associated with intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is associated with strength and endurance.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for common health issues:

### Eye Care

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

For more detailed information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Dry, light, cold, and rough. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

Consult a qualified ayurvedic practitioner before trying any remedies mentioned in this book.

Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha is heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalanced Kapha can result in weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

In Ayurveda, seasonal changes can impact our health and well-being. Here are some remedies for the spring season to balance Kapha dosha:

- Include herbs like ginger, black pepper, pippali, cumin, coriander, and fennel in your diet.
- Avoid heavy, oily, sour, sweet, and salty foods that provoke Kapha. Opt for bitter, pungent, and astringent foods instead.
- Limit dairy products, ice cream, and cold drinks as they can aggravate Kapha.
- Engage in kapha-reducing yoga postures and pranayama techniques like Bhastrika and Right Nostril breathing.
- Consider a juice fast with apple, pomegranate, or berry juice to cleanse your system.
- Avoid daytime naps as they can worsen Kapha imbalance.

As the weather transitions from spring to summer, adapt your diet and lifestyle to pacify Pitta dosha. Stay mindful of your body's needs and maintain balance throughout the changing seasons.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.

# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA (HUMMING BREATH)

When doing bhramari, touch the tip of your tongue lightly to the edge of the soft palate near the back of the roof of your mouth. Be sure the teeth are not clenched.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Meditation Technique for Inner Peace

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.
---
# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

## Double-Arrowed Attention (Witnessing)
---
# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

WITNESSING AWARENESS

Object - Me

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

Vata: Characterized by qualities of dry, light, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, liquid, and oily.

Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Sweet Taste

The sweet taste is present in foods such as rice, sugar, milk, wheat, dates, and maple syrup. It increases the vital essence of life and promotes growth of all seven dhatus. Proper use gives strength and longevity.

Benefits: Encourages the senses, improves complexion, promotes healthy skin, hair, and voice, relieves thirst and burning sensations, and promotes stability.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

Effects of Excess: Excessive use can cause thirst, hyperacidity, heartburn, ulcers, skin conditions, and acid pH imbalance in the body.

### Salty Taste

Examples include sea salt, rock salt, and kelp. Salt, when used moderately, relieves vata, increases pitta and kapha, promotes growth, and aids digestion.

Caution: Too much salt may lead to thickening of blood, hypertension, skin issues, water retention, and other health problems.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body. Imbalance in the doshas can lead to various health issues.

## Effects of Tastes on the Doshas

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

You can alleviate some of the ill effects of these combinations by using spices and herbs in your cooking. A strong digestive fire can be

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

These remedies can help balance emotions and control anger and hostility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

Calming Tea: Make a tea using specific herbs:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Appetite, Low

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.

# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

In some cases, the licorice tea may induce vomiting, which can be beneficial in eliminating kapha and relieving bronchial spasms.

### Important Note:

Prepare the tea as soon as you feel an attack coming on to prevent serious breathing problems. The tea remains effective for up to 72 hours.

## Herbal Remedies for Long-Term Prevention

For long-term prevention of asthma, you can try the following herbal remedies:

- Mix 1 teaspoon cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon trikatu in boiling water. Add honey before drinking. Take this tea twice a day.
- Prepare a tea with half licorice and half ginger for asthma prevention. Use half a teaspoon of the herbs per cup of water.

These herbal remedies can be beneficial when taken regularly to prevent asthma attacks.

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Boil Remedies

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Formula for Healthy Lactation

To maintain healthy lactation, use the following herbal formula:

- kutki 2 parts
- shilajit 2 parts
- shatavari 3 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Mineral Supplements for Brittle Nails

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.

# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Constipation

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Constipation

## Raisins

A handful of raisins every day, at least an hour after meals.

## Prunes

## Peaches

One or two peaches about an hour after meals.

## Eat More Fiber

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help keep the bowels regular. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are also high in fiber.

## Milk and Ghee

Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at bedtime is an effective and gentle means of relieving constipation, especially for vata and pitta constitutions.

## Castor Oil

Castor oil can be used for obstinate constipation. A remedy is to make ginger tea, add 2 teaspoons of castor oil, and drink it before bedtime. Adjust the dose as needed.

Suggestion: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends when you can stay home.

## Flaxseed

Boil 1 tablespoon of flaxseed in a cup of water at night for at least 2 to 3 minutes. Drink the whole cupful, including the tea and seeds.

## For Constipation in Children

Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.

## For Severe Constipation

If there is absolute constipation for three days, avoid purgatives. Instead, do an enema with warm water or herbal tea like triphala or dashamoola.

## Prevention

Here are several suggestions for avoiding constipation in the future.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

## Simple and Best Remedy for Irritated Eyes

Put a single drop of pure, genuine castor oil (without preservatives) into your eyes at bedtime. Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles of your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil from staining your sheets.

## Bloodshot Eyes Remedy

If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange juice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.

### Fainting and Dizziness

Additional information on fainting and dizziness remedies can be found in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.
---
# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

It is important to note that unhealthy hair may indicate poor absorption of minerals, affecting bone health. The health of hair and nails can reflect bone health.

## Proper Diet

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Jatamamsi Remedy for Hangover

Ingredients:

- Jatamamsi - 3 parts

Instructions:

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day. Put it on your tongue and wash down with warm water.

Additional Tips:

- Drinking coconut water is beneficial for a hangover.
- Using nasya with bhringaraj oil or brahmi ghee can be effective.
- The herbal compound tikta is an effective antidote for alcohol toxicity.

## Headaches in Ayurveda

Headaches in Ayurveda are classified based on doshas:

- Vata type: Occipital area or left side headaches due to vata imbalance.
- Pitta type: Temple area headaches due to excess pitta and acidic conditions.
- Kapha type: Frontal and nasal area headaches due to kapha imbalance.

Other causes of headaches in Ayurveda include ear problems, eye problems, food allergies, and poor sleeping positions.

Treatment in Ayurveda is specific to the individual's dosha imbalance and the root cause of the headache.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

5. Avoid spicy and oily foods that can trigger heartburn and acid reflux.

By incorporating these Ayurvedic home remedies into your routine, you can effectively manage heartburn and acid stomach issues naturally.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

### Time to See the Doctor:

There are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, uremic hiccups, and cerebral hiccups, which require medical attention.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Congestion, High Pitta, or Crystal Urea in the Kidney

Congestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all create tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests the following simple remedies:

### Herbal Mixture

Prepare a mixture of the following herbs:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Gokshura - 1 part
- Fennel seed - 1 part

Take 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it down with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Memory Improvement

## Fruit Fast for Memory Enhancement

A fruit fast can be beneficial for memory improvement as it helps in detoxifying the body and enhancing mental clarity. However, it should be avoided by individuals prone to hypoglycemia. Recommended fruits for the fast based on doshas:

- For Vata: Papayas, prunes, mangoes
- For Pitta: Grapes, pomegranates, apples
- For Kapha: Apples, cranberries, pomegranates

## Other Foods for Memory Improvement

In addition to fruits, certain foods can help in improving memory. Foods like sweet potatoes, tapioca, okra, and spinach are beneficial. Sattvic foods, including fresh fruits, vegetables, almonds, oranges, ghee, and milk, are good for memory enhancement. Avoid heavy meats if you have memory issues.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

- Ginkgo and Gotu Kola: These herbs improve memory by increasing circulation to the brain.
- Medhya Herbs: Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Bhringaraj, and Shanka Pushpi are specific herbs that improve memory. You can make a tea by steeping these herbs in hot water and drink it twice a day for a month.
- Brahmi Milk: Boil Brahmi in milk and drink it at bedtime for remarkable memory improvement. Add saffron for additional benefits.

Consistent use of these herbs and practices can help in enhancing memory and cognitive function over time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and memory problems.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta imbalance may manifest as inflammation and irritability.

Kapha: Comprised of earth and water elements, Kapha provides structure and stability. Imbalance can result in lethargy and congestion.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Memory Problems

Memory problems can be caused by stress and anxiety. Regular meditation, such as the Empty Bowl or So-Hum meditation, can help relieve stress and improve memory.

Avoiding toxic substances like alcohol, marijuana, and certain drugs is crucial for maintaining good memory function. Nicotine toxicity from smoking can also impact memory negatively.

### Menopause Problems

Menopause is a natural phase in a woman's life marked by hormonal changes. Following a vata-pacifying diet and incorporating aloe vera gel and mineral supplements can help alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings.

### Natural Hormone Sources

Consider incorporating natural sources of hormones like aloe vera gel and mineral supplements containing calcium, magnesium, and zinc to support hormonal balance during menopause.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Menopausal Women

It has become commonplace for modern medicine to prescribe hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women. Ayurveda recommends female rejuvenating herbs like shatavari and wild yam to prevent and alleviate menopausal symptoms. These herbs provide natural food precursors of estrogen and progesterone.

Try a mixture of vidari or wild yam and shatavari twice a day after lunch and dinner during menopause. This can help with symptoms like hot flashes and prevent osteoporosis.

## Hot Flashes

For hot flashes, drink a cup of pomegranate juice with rock candy powder or organic sugar and lime juice 2-3 times a day as needed.

## Vaginal Dryness

To alleviate vaginal dryness, insert a tampon-like shape cotton soaked in sesame oil into the vagina at night. Use a sanitary pad to catch any leakage.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga postures like Sun Salutation, Lotus, Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, Leg Lifts, and Chest-Knee pose to strengthen the lower abdominal area.

## Dysmenorrhea

According to Ayurveda, dysmenorrhea can be divided into three types: vata, pitta, and kapha. Identifying the specific type is crucial for effective treatment.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Menstrual Discomfort

## Understanding Menstrual Discomfort Based on Doshas

Menstrual discomfort can vary based on one's dosha type. It's important to note that these difficulties can be independent of one's own constitutional type. Here are some characteristics based on doshas:

### Vata

For vata-type dysmenorrhea, symptoms may include more pain before menstruation, bloating, lower abdominal pain, constipation, cramps, and insomnia. Menstrual flow tends to be scanty.

### Pitta

Pitta-type dysmenorrhea involves congestion, inflammation, and irritation. Symptoms may include tender breasts, sensitive bladder, burning sensation while urinating, hot flashes, and irritability. It may lead to profuse menstrual flow.

### Kapha

In kapha-type menstrual difficulties, there is congestion and pain typically occurs in the later part of the menstrual period. Symptoms may include white discharge, bloating, water retention, feelings of heaviness, lethargy, and drowsiness.

## Treatments for Dysmenorrhea

Here are some effective treatments for each type of disorder:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Menstrual Problems

## KAPHA Dosha

Kapha-type menstrual problems can be effectively treated by using a mixture of:

- punarnava ½ part
- manjistha ½ part
- trikatu ⅛ part

Take about ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, washed down with warm water.

Application of mustard oil and castor oil (half and half) to the lower abdomen will also help with kapha-type menstrual discomfort.

### Important Note

If self-treatment is not working or appears to be making the condition worse, reassess the situation and try a different line of treatment. Consult a trained Ayurvedic diagnostician if needed.

## For All Body Types

Herbal Remedies: Ayurvedic medicine includes powerful herbal compounds based on the herb guggulu. Choose the following based on your dosha:

- Vata-type pain: triphala guggulu or yogaraj guggulu
- Pitta: kaishore guggulu
- Kapha: punarnava guggulu

Take one tablet twice a day. These tablets are generally available from sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Universal Remedy: Roast cumin seeds until pungent, chew about 1 teaspoon slowly, and follow with one tablespoon aloe vera juice.

### For Excessive Menstrual Flow

A tea made of raspberry leaves and hibiscus flowers is often effective. Also, try drinking coconut water with rock candy powder added or eating fresh raspberries on an empty stomach.

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

Perhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to prevent menstrual problems. You can follow this strategy quite easily, effectively, safely, and inexpensively.

ALOE VERA GEL: For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual pain and discomfort.

DIETARY GUIDELINES: Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

YOGA POSITIONS: Throughout the month, spend a few minutes every day on the yoga postures recommended for your body type. Yoga asanas are not recommended during the menstrual period. Just rest, read, and relax as much as possible.

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Migraine Headaches

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

## Preventing and Treating Muscle Cramps

Soak It: For a cramp in your foot, soak the foot in a bucket of warm water that contains salt (1 or 2 tablespoons).

Herbal Relaxants: Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, jatamamsi tea, or comfrey tea. You can also make a tea using equal amounts of all three herbs (⅓ teaspoon of each per cup) to relax your muscles.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

Warm Milk: Warm milk is helpful for abdominal muscle cramps due to its alkaline property and calcium content. Drinking one cup of warm milk at bedtime can help pacify acidity and relax muscles.

Lasunadivati (Garlic Compound): Effective for smooth muscle spasm. Take 1 tablet after dinner for 5 days. Garlic relaxes muscles, calms vata dosha, and helps with muscle cramps.

Hingwastak Churna: Take 1/4 teaspoon twice a day after lunch and dinner to relieve abdominal muscle pain. May cause gas.

Triphala: Relieves gases, aids in proper elimination, and helps absorb minerals. Take 1/2 teaspoon at bedtime with warm water to prevent stomach muscle cramps.

## Nasal Crust

When kapha dosha is high, nasal crust may form due to dryness in the atmosphere. Remedies include:

- Steam Inhalation: Inhale steam with ginger, ajwan, and turmeric to ease nasal discharge and breathe freely.
- Menthol and Eucalyptus: Rub menthol on the forehead and sinus area for relief.

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

- Avoid feeding the child’s imagination with disturbing images.
- Engage children in creative play and avoid violent or horrifying TV programs or stories.
- Create a pleasant environment in the child's room with sweet music and tinkling bells.
- Tell positive and uplifting stories to children.
- Give the child a mini-oil massage before bed using brahmi oil or bhringaraj oil.
- Prevent bedwetting by limiting fluid intake before bedtime and consider cumin-coriander-fennel tea.

## Remedies for Adults and Children

Tranquillity Tea:

- Ingredients: jatamamsi, brahmi, ginkgo, yashti madhu (licorice root).
- Instructions: Make a tea from equal proportions of the above ingredients. Drink a cup before bedtime for a peaceful mind and body.
- Alternative: Make a tea of equal amounts of jatamamsi and shanka pushpi.

These remedies are beneficial for both children and adults to promote relaxation and peaceful sleep.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Governs digestion and metabolism.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, soft, and cold. Governs structure and lubrication in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Nosebleeds

To stop nosebleeds, try using pomegranate nose drops by placing a few drops of fresh pomegranate juice in your nostrils. If the bleeding persists, consult a doctor as it could indicate an underlying health issue like high blood pressure or leukemia.

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet by avoiding hot and spicy foods, alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive sun exposure.

### Obesity

Obesity is a condition of excessive body fat accumulation that can lead to various health problems. It is primarily a Kapha disorder caused by overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and lack of exercise.

Factors contributing to obesity include hereditary issues, pregnancy weight gain, stress-induced eating, and certain medications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

Obesity is often caused by eating too much and not getting enough exercise. Factors such as consuming cold drinks, fatty fried foods, dairy products like cheese and ice cream, and excess sugar and carbohydrates can contribute to obesity.

## Watch Your Diet

Control what you eat by following a kapha-pacifying diet. Avoid cold drinks, fatty fried foods, and minimize dairy products. Include salads, beans, and drink hot water or herbal teas like ginger, mint, or cinnamon. Limit meat consumption to fish or chicken once a month.

## Get Adequate Exercise

Engage in regular exercise such as daily walks, aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming, and weight lifting with 5-pound weights. Remember that burning more calories than you consume is essential for weight loss.

## Post-Exercise Prescription

Avoid cold drinks and snacks after exercise. Opt for hot drinks like herbal teas to maintain a healthy metabolism.

## Eat Your Biggest Meal Early in the Day

Skip breakfast if possible, have a substantial meal at noon, and keep supper light. Avoid snacking between meals and consider skipping supper entirely.

## Drop Alcohol and Tobacco

Avoid alcohol and tobacco consumption as these habits can contribute to obesity.

## Listen to Music

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more, so that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and body temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of water and earth. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by thinning and increasing porosity of the bones, often due to increased Vata dosha. It is more common in women, especially after menopause, due to hormonal changes.

Remedies:

- Engage in gentle, daily exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Walking, swimming, or gentle jogging are recommended.
- Include weight-bearing exercises cautiously, especially if diagnosed with osteoporosis, to avoid the risk of fractures.
- Ensure a diet rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other nutrients essential for bone health.

By following these remedies and making lifestyle changes, individuals can manage osteoporosis effectively and improve bone health over time.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

Food nourishes the body; love nourishes the soul. Overeating can be caused by emotional factors such as loneliness, grief, sadness, or depression. In Ayurveda, overeating is linked to prana vata stimulating jatharagni, leading to increased hunger.

## Ways to Deal with Overeating:

1. Express Your Feelings: Write about your feelings to release blocked energy in the solar plexus.
2. Meditate and Breathe: Practice So-Hum meditation or Shitali pranayama to reduce emotional hunger.
3. Yoga: Practice specific yoga exercises like Moon Salutation, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Spinal Twist to control overeating.
4. Walk Off the Cravings: Take a brisk walk for 20 minutes to reduce emotional cravings for food.
5. Eat Lightly: Opt for light foods like crackers, millet, rye, or fruit juice to satisfy hunger without gaining weight.
6. Try Bananas: Eating a ripe banana with ghee and cardamom can help pacify emotional eating habits.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle changes, overeating due to emotional factors can be effectively managed.

## Test Your Hunger

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts
- Cumin 1 part
- Raw natural sugar 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot milk, and drink it once or twice a day until the condition is healed.

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.

- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

... (Additional content truncated for brevity) ...
Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.

---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Stress Relief

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

Find the right match between your job and your personality. Job stress can be a burden when work and personality are not appropriately matched. Discover your true role and goal to reduce stress.

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

## Medicated Nose Drops

Try nasya with brahmi ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee into each nostril for relief. Refer to the nasya instructions for proper usage.

## Stress-Reducing Tea

Prepare a relaxing tea using herbs like chamomile, comfrey, angelica, or brahmi. These teas can help manage stress when consumed 2-3 times a day.

## Yoga Stretching

Practice specific asanas like Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose for stress management. The Lion pose is also effective in relieving stress.

## Meditation

Sit in the Lotus pose or Easy pose, facing east, and meditate. Focus on your breath or try the So-Hum meditation for stress relief.

## Breathe Away Stress

Practice Ujjayi pranayama for calming effects. You can do this breathing exercise sitting up or lying down in Savasana for stress relief.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

## Gentle Stretching

Careful, gentle stretching of the affected muscles will gradually help to improve circulation and heal the pain and inflammation.

## Take Anti-Inflammatory Herbs

Taking some anti-inflammatory herbs will accelerate healing. Make this formula:

- kaishore guggulu 2 parts

Oil Massage: Gently massage the affected area with mahanarayan oil and soak it in warm water.

## Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ears)

Herbal Remedies: According to Ayurveda, ringing in the ear is a vata disorder. To alleviate this root cause, prepare a tea made from equal amounts of comfrey, cinnamon, and chamomile. Drink 2 or 3 times a day.

- Take yogaraj guggulu (200 mg. 2 or 3 times a day) with warm water after food.
- Gently rub the mastoid bone with warm sesame oil twice a day for a week.
- Place 3 drops of garlic oil into your ear at night before bed.

Refer to the appendix for more information on preparing oils like garlic oil.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

## Douche for Vaginal Yeast Infection

If the yeast infection is vaginal, you will find it helpful to douche with licorice tea. Follow these steps:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of licorice powder in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.

NOTE: If you have a thick discharge from the genitals, along with an itching and burning sensation, it will be better to do the douche with triphala tea instead of licorice. Use the same procedure: take 1 tablespoon of triphala, boil it in a pint of water, cool, strain, and use the tea as a douche.

# Ayurveda Conclusion

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

# Gems and Stones

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

This powerful precious stone brings prosperity and spiritual awakening. It calms vata and pitta, settles the nervous system, and relieves nervousness. Symbolic of the planet Mercury, emeralds improve writing skills, enhance the power of speech, and promote intelligence. They are best set in gold and worn on the little finger.

This very powerful gemstone combats premature aging, enhances the span of life, and strengthens immunity. Its energy brings subtle energy vibrations to the heart, brain, and deeper bodily tissues. It is the best stone for rejuvenation. It brings prosperity and is spiritually uplifting.

The doshic effects of diamonds vary according to their color. Red diamonds have a fiery energy that stimulates pitta; blue diamonds are cooling and calm pitta while increasing kapha. Clear, colorless diamonds calm pitta but increase both vata and kapha.

Symbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in relationships and are rightfully associated with marriage. These stones stimulate shukra, the body’s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this stone. Wear your diamond set in gold, either as a necklace or as a ring on the ring finger. But note: Diamonds of low quality may have negative effects upon the body.

## Red Coral

This gemstone from the sea represents the planet Mars. It calms pitta and helps one to control anger, hatred, and jealousy. Coral gives energy to the liver, spleen, and pericardium. Wear your red coral as a necklace or as a ring set in copper (preferably), silver, or white gold and worn on the ring finger. Red coral is strength-giving and imparts gracefulness.

## Opal

This semiprecious stone represents the planet Neptune. It strengthens majja dhatu (bone marrow and nerves) as well as shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue). It improves vision, relieves fever, calms pitta, and is good for migraine headaches. Opals enhance spiritual feelings, increase devotion, and help to unfold intuition. This gem is particularly beneficial for individuals with Neptune in their third, fourth, sixth, tenth, or twelfth astrological house. It should be set in gold or silver and worn on the ring finger.

## Cat’s-Eye

This stone is good for allergies, repeated colds and congestion, and allergic asthma. It pacifies kapha and vata while slightly increasing pitta. It aids in healing kidney dysfunction. Cat’s-eye enhances awareness and helps a person not get caught up in emotions. People working in psychological healing should wear this stone in a gold setting on their ring or little finger; it will help protect them from negative influences.

## Quartz Crystals

These stones have a Venus-like vibratory energy that is somewhat like that of diamonds. They calm vata, improve the quality of perception, strengthen communication, and enhance intuition. You can wear quartz crystals as a necklace, or set in either silver or gold and worn on the ring finger.

## Onyx

This stone is excellent for vata disorders. It is good for old age, debilitating disorders, and neurological dysfunction, and it helps with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and even schizophrenia. It induces quiet, deep sleep yet combats lethargy. It is good for memory and promotes positive thinking. Onyx makes life peaceful and happy and enhances love in relationships. It has energy vibrations that are Sun-like and Jupiter-like. This stone should be set in silver and worn on the ring finger. (If your Sun sign is in Sagittarius or Gemini, it is better not to wear this stone.)

## Jade

Jade is beneficial for longevity. It strengthens kidney energy and is reputed to bestow success upon its wearer. This stone is also good for the power of speech. It helps to prevent cataracts and is strengthening for the prostate. Wear a jade ring set in silver, on your little finger.

## Amethyst

Amethyst is a stone for the crown chakra and is good for mental clarity. To bring prosperity, it should be set in gold. You can also wear it around the neck on a gold necklace. A person with neuromuscular weakness can be helped by wearing amethysts and by putting them at the four corners of the bed. Some amethysts have a darker color, which gives them a Saturn-like energy similar to blue sapphire. Amethysts bestow dignity, love, compassion, and hope. This gem helps the individual to control emotions and is good for vata and pitta imbalance.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and temperature regulation.

Kapha is associated with the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. Each illness is approached holistically, taking into account the individual's dosha constitution and overall health.

### Red

Red is a warming and stimulating color. It can relieve aggravated Vata and reduce excess Kapha. However, overexposure to red may aggravate Pitta and lead to inflammatory ailments. Red stimulates the formation of red blood cells, improves circulation, and gives energy to nerve tissue and bone marrow.

### Orange

Orange is a warming color with healing energy. It is sexually stimulating and provides energy to the sex organs. Orange is balancing to Vata and Kapha but may aggravate Pitta. It has antibacterial properties and hinders the growth of bacteria.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

This appendix briefly explains the preparation of herbs and special remedies such as medicated oils and ghees and offers suggestions on their use. For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee. Lubricate the syringe tip with oil or ghee, insert it into the rectum, and release the clip to allow the fluid to enter. Hold the fluid for 10 minutes, then assume a hands-and-knees position to relax the colon. Massage the colon area lightly in a counterclockwise motion. Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

## Nasya

Nasya is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or fine powders. When self-administering nasya, dip your clean finger into the recommended oil or ghee, and gently massage the inside of your nostril before sniffing to draw the oil upward.

# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

Ayurveda is considered the mother of all healing systems, with its roots in ancient Indian texts and practices. It encompasses various branches such as pediatrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, surgery, and more. These branches have influenced modern medicine and healing modalities like massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture.

## The Wisdom of Charaka

Charaka, a renowned sage-physician and one of the founders of Ayurvedic medicine, emphasized the importance of approaching patients with love and light. He believed that true healing comes from a place of compassion and understanding.

### A Message of Love

This book is a labor of love, crafted with the intention of sharing valuable knowledge for self-healing and well-being. May the remedies and suggestions offered here serve as a guide on your journey to health and healing.

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

The five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth - form the basis of material creation and are present in all matter, including the human body.

### Space (Ether):

Space is universal, formless, and all-pervading. It is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. Psychologically, space provides freedom and peace but can also lead to feelings of emptiness and insecurity.

### Ayurvedic Remedies:

For remedies related to specific illnesses and imbalances, refer to the comprehensive A-Z guide provided in this book.

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three primary doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific elements and governs various bodily functions.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is characterized by the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with fire and water elements. It governs metabolism and digestion, as well as emotions and intellect.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha combines water and earth elements. It provides structure and stability to the body, as well as lubrication and immunity.

## Imbalance and Remedies

When a dosha is out of balance, it can lead to various physical and emotional ailments. Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal treatments.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This comprehensive guide provides information on a wide range of illnesses and their corresponding ayurvedic remedies. From common colds to chronic conditions, Ayurveda offers natural solutions for healing.

## Conclusion

By understanding the doshas and their characteristics, as well as incorporating ayurvedic practices into daily life, individuals can achieve optimal health and well-being.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of balancing the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and well-being. Understanding the qualities associated with each dosha is crucial in identifying imbalances and restoring harmony.

## Qualities of Doshas:

- Vata: Associated with dryness, constipation, emaciation, and irregularity.
- Pitta: Linked to heat, burning sensations, inflammation, and irritability.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, lethargy, congestion, and excess mucus.

Ayurvedic treatment involves aligning lifestyle choices with your unique constitution to promote balance and health. Self-awareness, observation, and a willingness to act on your knowledge are key factors in achieving optimal well-being.

The remedies provided in this book are designed to assist you in restoring balance and vitality. By making conscious choices in diet, exercise, and daily routines, you can support your body's natural healing processes and enhance overall health.

Remember, small adjustments in your daily habits can have a significant impact on your well-being. Listen to your body, honor its needs, and cultivate a lifestyle that nurtures harmony and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of mind, body, and spirit to prevent and treat illnesses.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics that influence an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

### Vata Dosha

One of the main psychological qualities of vata individuals is readiness to change. They are often restless, quick-thinking, and creative. However, they may also experience instability and lack of grounding. Vata types tend to have dry skin, light body frames, and cold hands and feet.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are known for their intense focus, determination, and strong digestion. They can be competitive and ambitious, but may also be prone to anger and irritability when out of balance. Pitta types typically have a medium build, sharp intellect, and warm body temperature.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha types are characterized by their calm and nurturing nature. They are often patient, loving, and compassionate. However, they can also be prone to lethargy and weight gain when imbalanced. Kapha individuals usually have strong, sturdy builds, smooth skin, and a tendency towards sluggish digestion.

- Kapha: Characteristics include stability, calmness, and tendency towards lethargy and weight gain. Excess kapha can result in congestion, weight gain, and attachment.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Excess vata is a major factor in PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Symptoms of aggravated vata include bloating, low back ache, anxiety, and insomnia. To balance vata, individuals should stick to a routine, dress warmly, and consume warm, moist foods.

### General Guidelines for Balancing Vata

- Keep warm
- Keep calm
- Avoid raw foods
- Avoid cold foods
- Avoid extreme cold temperatures
- Eat warm foods and spices
- Keep a regular routine

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

### LIKE INCREASES LIKE

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Governs movement, creativity, and communication.
- Pitta: Governs digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governs stability, strength, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Deposition or Infiltration

The aggravated dosha enters weak or defective organs or tissues, leading to pathological changes. Factors like trauma, genetic predisposition, and emotional stress can contribute to this.

### Manifestation

In this stage, signs and symptoms of the disease become apparent, and the person falls sick. Disease manifests in the area of the defective tissue.

### Cellular Deformity Leading to Structural Distortion

At this stage, the disease is fully developed, and structural changes occur. Complications may arise in other organs or tissues.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent disease.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues
6. Destruction (Bheda): Manifestation of signs and symptoms

Awareness and prevention play a key role in maintaining health according to Ayurveda. By understanding one's constitution and making mindful choices in diet and lifestyle, one can prevent the abnormal movement of doshas and promote normal functioning.

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

One of the key treatments in Ayurveda is Panchakarma, a five-procedure program aimed at detoxifying the body. The program includes preparatory methods like internal oleation with ghee, external oleation with oil massage and sweating, and specific actions to eliminate excess doshas and toxins.

Some of the procedures involved in Panchakarma include therapeutic vomiting (vamana), purgation or laxative therapy (virechana), medicated enema therapy (basti), nasal administration of medication (nasya), and purification of the blood (rakta moksha).

Ayurveda also offers other methods to remove toxins from the body based on the individual's strength and the severity of the disease.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls metabolism and digestion. An excess of Pitta can result in inflammation, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Influenced by the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs stability and structure. Imbalance in Kapha may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Panchakarma: A powerful cleansing procedure in Ayurveda that is tailored to each individual's constitution and medical condition. It requires close supervision and post-treatment support.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, constipation, and insomnia.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and indigestion.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may cause congestion, lethargy, and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Home remedies in Ayurveda aim not only to treat the symptoms but also to purify the body and prevent future diseases. Rejuvenation and rebuilding are essential aspects of Ayurvedic healing.

### Schedule for Home Panchakarma

Here is an ideal schedule for your home panchakarma purification treatment:

|Day|Internal|External|Oil Bath|Basti|Your Doshic Diet|Diet|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Monday|Monodiet Kitchari|Kitchari with steamed vegetables|Coriander/cumin/fennel tea| | | |

### Rejuvenation and Rebuilding

The purpose of panchakarma is not just to get well but to purify and strengthen the body for long-term health. Rejuvenatives like rasayanas promote renewal and longevity at the cellular level.

#### Rejuvenative Herbs

- Vata: Ashwagandha in hot milk twice a day.
- Pitta: Shatavari in warm milk twice a day.
- Kapha: Punarnava in warm water twice a day.

Herbal mixtures like chyavanprash can also be used to tonify the system and enhance overall health.

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism. It is associated with intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is associated with strength and endurance.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for common health issues:

### Eye Care

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

For more detailed information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Dry, light, cold, and rough. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

Consult a qualified ayurvedic practitioner before trying any remedies mentioned in this book.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.
---
# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Meditation Technique for Inner Peace

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.

# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

Vata: Characterized by qualities of dry, light, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, liquid, and oily.

Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Sweet Taste

The sweet taste is present in foods such as rice, sugar, milk, wheat, dates, and maple syrup. It increases the vital essence of life and promotes growth of all seven dhatus. Proper use gives strength and longevity.

Benefits: Encourages the senses, improves complexion, promotes healthy skin, hair, and voice, relieves thirst and burning sensations, and promotes stability.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

Effects of Excess: Excessive use can cause thirst, hyperacidity, heartburn, ulcers, skin conditions, and acid pH imbalance in the body.

### Salty Taste

Examples include sea salt, rock salt, and kelp. Salt, when used moderately, relieves vata, increases pitta and kapha, promotes growth, and aids digestion.

Caution: Too much salt may lead to thickening of blood, hypertension, skin issues, water retention, and other health problems.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body. Imbalance in the doshas can lead to various health issues.

## Effects of Tastes on the Doshas

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda Overview: Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health that originated in India thousands of years ago. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain overall well-being.

## Doshas and Characteristics:

- Vata: Characteristics include dryness, coldness, lightness, and mobility.
- Pitta: Characteristics include heat, intensity, lightness, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heaviness, coldness, softness, and stability.

## Important Notes:

Herbal Medications: Ayurveda offers a vast pharmacopoeia of herbal preparations for various conditions. Simple remedies using common kitchen herbs or household strategies are recommended.

Experimentation: Try different remedies for a specific condition and observe how your body responds. Adjust the treatment based on the results.

Correct Diagnosis: If a remedy doesn't work as expected, reassess your diagnosis. Consider trying remedies for a different dosha that aligns better with your symptoms.

Treating Your Condition: Focus on treating the actual imbalance or illness based on your symptoms rather than just your constitutional type.

Duration of Remedies: Use remedies until your symptoms improve, and adjust or change them as needed.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

These remedies can help balance emotions and control anger and hostility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Appetite, Low

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.

# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Boil Remedies

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Mineral Supplements for Brittle Nails

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body.
- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.

# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Constipation

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Constipation

## Raisins

A handful of raisins every day, at least an hour after meals.

## Prunes

## Peaches

One or two peaches about an hour after meals.

## Eat More Fiber

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help keep the bowels regular. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are also high in fiber.

## Milk and Ghee

Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at bedtime is an effective and gentle means of relieving constipation, especially for vata and pitta constitutions.

## Castor Oil

Castor oil can be used for obstinate constipation. A remedy is to make ginger tea, add 2 teaspoons of castor oil, and drink it before bedtime. Adjust the dose as needed.

Suggestion: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends when you can stay home.

## Flaxseed

Boil 1 tablespoon of flaxseed in a cup of water at night for at least 2 to 3 minutes. Drink the whole cupful, including the tea and seeds.

## For Constipation in Children

Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.

## For Severe Constipation

If there is absolute constipation for three days, avoid purgatives. Instead, do an enema with warm water or herbal tea like triphala or dashamoola.

## Prevention

Here are several suggestions for avoiding constipation in the future.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

For best results, follow this schedule:

- Week 1: Every day
- Week 2: Every 2 days
- Week 3: Every 3 days
- Week 4: Once

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

## Simple and Best Remedy for Irritated Eyes

Put a single drop of pure, genuine castor oil (without preservatives) into your eyes at bedtime. Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles of your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil from staining your sheets.

## Bloodshot Eyes Remedy

If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange juice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.

### Fainting and Dizziness

Additional information on fainting and dizziness remedies can be found in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

Combine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and...

### Important Note

This liver-flushing treatment should not be done without the approval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an Ayurvedic physician to avoid damaging the gallbladder and experiencing dangerous complications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

It is important to note that unhealthy hair may indicate poor absorption of minerals, affecting bone health. The health of hair and nails can reflect bone health.

## Proper Diet

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

- The herbal compound tikta is an effective antidote for alcohol toxicity.

## Headaches in Ayurveda

Headaches in Ayurveda are classified based on doshas:

- Vata type: Occipital area or left side headaches due to vata imbalance.
- Pitta type: Temple area headaches due to excess pitta and acidic conditions.
- Kapha type: Frontal and nasal area headaches due to kapha imbalance.

Other causes of headaches in Ayurveda include ear problems, eye problems, food allergies, and poor sleeping positions.

Treatment in Ayurveda is specific to the individual's dosha imbalance and the root cause of the headache.

## Vata-Type Headaches

Vata-type headaches are located in the back (occipital) portion of the head. They are characterized by throbbing, pulsating pain that radiates from the back of the head to the front.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

5. Avoid spicy and oily foods that can trigger heartburn and acid reflux.

By incorporating these Ayurvedic home remedies into your routine, you can effectively manage heartburn and acid stomach issues naturally.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

### Time to See the Doctor:

There are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, uremic hiccups, and cerebral hiccups, which require medical attention.

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

### Pitta Dosha

Characteristics: Intelligent, focused, goal-oriented, prone to anger when imbalanced.

### Kapha Dosha

Characteristics: Nurturing, calm, patient, prone to lethargy when imbalanced.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Herbs for Hypertension

Ayurveda suggests the following mixture of herbs for hypertension:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Passion flower - 1 part
- Hawthorn berry - 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

One effective Ayurvedic remedy for regulating blood pressure is a tea made from the following herbs:

- Jatamamsi - 2 parts
- Musta - 2 parts
- Tagar - 1 part

Steep ½ teaspoon of the herb mixture in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drink the tea after lunch and dinner.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Keep Cool: Avoid working hard under the hot sun if you have high blood pressure to prevent promoting hemorrhage in the brain.

Magnetic Water: Drink magnetic water by placing a cup of water next to the north pole of a magnet for 2 hours. Drink a cupful of magnetic water twice a day to help control blood pressure.

Rudraksha: Soak 1 or 2 rudraksha beads in a cup of water overnight and drink the water the next day to regulate blood pressure.

## Deep Relaxation to Help High Blood Pressure

Tension and stress can increase high blood pressure. Try the yogic rest pose, savasana, for deep relaxation:

Lie flat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the flow of your breath and practice quiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes. This natural antidote for hypertension can help you relax.

Meditation: Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure and can be as effective as medications in controlling hypertension without negative side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

## Preventing Adult-Onset Diabetes

Ingredients:

- Shilajit - 1 part
- Shardunika - 1 part

Instructions: Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture after lunch and dinner with some water.

### Yoga Postures

Some yoga asanas to strengthen the pancreas and help prevent hypoglycemia include the Peacock, Camel, and Locust poses, and the Elevated Lotus, as well as nauli (an abdominal exercise explained in appendix 3). Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia should do these yoga exercises and Alternate Nostril breathing.

### Nasya

Brahmi ghee nasya, 5 drops in each nostril, will quickly relieve nausea, sweating, and mental confusion (see appendix 3).

### For Drowsiness

Drowsiness can be corrected by taking some sweet juice, such as pomegranate or sweet orange juice.

## Impotence Remedies

Impotence, which is a man’s inability to have or to maintain an erection, may have several causes. It can be due to emotional, psychological issues, stress, or certain physical problems.

Massage to Improve Circulation: Massage the pubic area and the root of the penis with a few drops of mahanarayan oil to improve circulation and potentially eliminate the problem.

Apply Herbalized Oil: Apply bala oil or ashwagandha oil directly to the penis.

Massage the Prostate Area: Massaging above the prostate gland with the mentioned oils or plain ghee can be beneficial for improving circulation.

## Strengthening Herbal Formula

For internal use, make a mixture of equal proportions of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day in warm milk, continuing for 3 months. Add chopped fresh garlic to the warm milk to improve blood supply and vessel dilation.

## Mild Aphrodisiac Drink

Every night, drink a cup of warm milk with a pinch of saffron added. Saffron is an aphrodisiac and increases sperm count.

## Relax with Tranquillity Tea

If impotence is psychological, try Tranquillity Tea containing jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi in equal proportions. Drink ½ teaspoon of this mixture before bed to alleviate emotional stress.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga poses like Rooster pose, Elevated Lotus, Vajrasana, Chakra Asana, and Bow pose to help with impotence. Refer to illustrations in appendix 4.

## Indigestion

The effectiveness of digestion depends on the strength of your digestive fire (agni). Avoid heavy, liquid, or dense food intake that can inhibit agni. Emotional eating and wrong food combining can also lead to indigestion.

For more information, refer to the chapter on "Urinary Incontinence" in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Kidney Issues

## Congestion, High Pitta, or Crystal Urea in the Kidney

Congestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all create tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests the following simple remedies:

### Herbal Mixture

Prepare a mixture of the following herbs:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Gokshura - 1 part
- Fennel seed - 1 part

Take 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it down with warm water.

### Cumin-Coriander-Fennel Tea

Prepare a tea by mixing equal amounts of cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds. Boil in water and drink 2 or 3 times a day. (Use about ¼ teaspoon of each herb per cup of water.)

### Ayurvedic Herb Drink

Combine about ½ teaspoon of musta with ½ teaspoon of fennel. Steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.

## Kidney Stones

There are different types of kidney stones corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha dosha:

- Calcium stones (kapha stones)
- Phosphate stones
- Oxalate stones (pitta stones)

### Herbal Remedies

If you already have a kidney stone, Ayurveda suggests Punarnava Guggulu and Gokshuradi Guggulu. Take one tablet of each twice a day after lunch and dinner.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Memory Improvement

## Fruit Fast for Memory Enhancement

A fruit fast can be beneficial for memory improvement as it helps in detoxifying the body and enhancing mental clarity. However, it should be avoided by individuals prone to hypoglycemia. Recommended fruits for the fast based on doshas:

- For Vata: Papayas, prunes, mangoes
- For Pitta: Grapes, pomegranates, apples
- For Kapha: Apples, cranberries, pomegranates

## Other Foods for Memory Improvement

In addition to fruits, certain foods can help in improving memory. Foods like sweet potatoes, tapioca, okra, and spinach are beneficial. Sattvic foods, including fresh fruits, vegetables, almonds, oranges, ghee, and milk, are good for memory enhancement. Avoid heavy meats if you have memory issues.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

- Ginkgo and Gotu Kola: These herbs improve memory by increasing circulation to the brain.
- Medhya Herbs: Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Bhringaraj, and Shanka Pushpi are specific herbs that improve memory. You can make a tea by steeping these herbs in hot water and drink it twice a day for a month.
- Brahmi Milk: Boil Brahmi in milk and drink it at bedtime for remarkable memory improvement. Add saffron for additional benefits.

Consistent use of these herbs and practices can help in enhancing memory and cognitive function over time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and memory problems.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta imbalance may manifest as inflammation and irritability.

Kapha: Comprised of earth and water elements, Kapha provides structure and stability. Imbalance can result in lethargy and congestion.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Memory Problems

Memory problems can be caused by stress and anxiety. Regular meditation, such as the Empty Bowl or So-Hum meditation, can help relieve stress and improve memory.

Avoiding toxic substances like alcohol, marijuana, and certain drugs is crucial for maintaining good memory function. Nicotine toxicity from smoking can also impact memory negatively.

### Menopause Problems

Menopause is a natural phase in a woman's life marked by hormonal changes. Following a vata-pacifying diet and incorporating aloe vera gel and mineral supplements can help alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings.

### Natural Hormone Sources

Consider incorporating natural sources of hormones like aloe vera gel and mineral supplements containing calcium, magnesium, and zinc to support hormonal balance during menopause.

It has become commonplace for modern medicine to prescribe hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women. Ayurveda recommends female rejuvenating herbs like shatavari and wild yam to prevent and alleviate menopausal symptoms. These herbs provide natural food precursors of estrogen and progesterone.

Try a mixture of vidari or wild yam and shatavari twice a day after lunch and dinner during menopause. This can help with symptoms like hot flashes and prevent osteoporosis.

## Hot Flashes

For hot flashes, drink a cup of pomegranate juice with rock candy powder or organic sugar and lime juice 2-3 times a day as needed.

## Vaginal Dryness

To alleviate vaginal dryness, insert a tampon-like shape cotton soaked in sesame oil into the vagina at night. Use a sanitary pad to catch any leakage.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga postures like Sun Salutation, Lotus, Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, Leg Lifts, and Chest-Knee pose to strengthen the lower abdominal area.

## Dysmenorrhea

According to Ayurveda, dysmenorrhea can be divided into three types: vata, pitta, and kapha. Identifying the specific type is crucial for effective treatment.

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

Perhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to prevent menstrual problems. You can follow this strategy quite easily, effectively, safely, and inexpensively.

ALOE VERA GEL: For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual pain and discomfort.

DIETARY GUIDELINES: Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

YOGA POSITIONS: Throughout the month, spend a few minutes every day on the yoga postures recommended for your body type. Yoga asanas are not recommended during the menstrual period. Just rest, read, and relax as much as possible.

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

## Migraine Headaches

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

## Preventing and Treating Muscle Cramps

Soak It: For a cramp in your foot, soak the foot in a bucket of warm water that contains salt (1 or 2 tablespoons).

Herbal Relaxants: Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, jatamamsi tea, or comfrey tea. You can also make a tea using equal amounts of all three herbs (⅓ teaspoon of each per cup) to relax your muscles.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

Triphala: Relieves gases, aids in proper elimination, and helps absorb minerals. Take 1/2 teaspoon at bedtime with warm water to prevent stomach muscle cramps.

## Nasal Crust

When kapha dosha is high, nasal crust may form due to dryness in the atmosphere. Remedies include:

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

- Avoid feeding the child’s imagination with disturbing images.
- Engage children in creative play and avoid violent or horrifying TV programs or stories.
- Create a pleasant environment in the child's room with sweet music and tinkling bells.
- Tell positive and uplifting stories to children.
- Give the child a mini-oil massage before bed using brahmi oil or bhringaraj oil.
- Prevent bedwetting by limiting fluid intake before bedtime and consider cumin-coriander-fennel tea.

## Remedies for Adults and Children

Tranquillity Tea:

- Ingredients: jatamamsi, brahmi, ginkgo, yashti madhu (licorice root).
- Instructions: Make a tea from equal proportions of the above ingredients. Drink a cup before bedtime for a peaceful mind and body.
- Alternative: Make a tea of equal amounts of jatamamsi and shanka pushpi.

These remedies are beneficial for both children and adults to promote relaxation and peaceful sleep.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Governs digestion and metabolism.

To stop nosebleeds, try using pomegranate nose drops by placing a few drops of fresh pomegranate juice in your nostrils. If the bleeding persists, consult a doctor as it could indicate an underlying health issue like high blood pressure or leukemia.

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet by avoiding hot and spicy foods, alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive sun exposure.

### Obesity

Obesity is a condition of excessive body fat accumulation that can lead to various health problems. It is primarily a Kapha disorder caused by overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and lack of exercise.

Factors contributing to obesity include hereditary issues, pregnancy weight gain, stress-induced eating, and certain medications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

Obesity is often caused by eating too much and not getting enough exercise. Factors such as consuming cold drinks, fatty fried foods, dairy products like cheese and ice cream, and excess sugar and carbohydrates can contribute to obesity.

## Watch Your Diet

Control what you eat by following a kapha-pacifying diet. Avoid cold drinks, fatty fried foods, and minimize dairy products. Include salads, beans, and drink hot water or herbal teas like ginger, mint, or cinnamon. Limit meat consumption to fish or chicken once a month.

## Get Adequate Exercise

Engage in regular exercise such as daily walks, aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming, and weight lifting with 5-pound weights. Remember that burning more calories than you consume is essential for weight loss.

## Post-Exercise Prescription

Avoid cold drinks and snacks after exercise. Opt for hot drinks like herbal teas to maintain a healthy metabolism.

## Eat Your Biggest Meal Early in the Day

Skip breakfast if possible, have a substantial meal at noon, and keep supper light. Avoid snacking between meals and consider skipping supper entirely.

## Drop Alcohol and Tobacco

Avoid alcohol and tobacco consumption as these habits can contribute to obesity.

## Listen to Music

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more, so that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

- Vata type is characterized by low backache, lower abdominal pain, distention, anxiety, fear, insomnia, and mood swings.
- Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, urethritis, hives, hot flashes, irritability, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.
- Kapha-type PMS involves water retention (breasts become enlarged and tender) and drowsiness, so that the woman loves to drink coffee!

PMS can be cared for successfully using the following Ayurvedic remedies and...

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Effective Herbs

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Formula:

Make a formula using the following Ayurvedic herbs:

- Punarnava - 2 parts
- Shilajit - ⅛ part
- Gokshura - 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of the mixture twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water. Continue until symptoms resolve.

## Teas for Relief:

You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea for relief. Follow the directions on the package or use bulk herbs by adding about 1 teaspoon of mixture to a cup of boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, cool, and drink.

## Time to See the Doctor:

If prostate cancer is a possible diagnosis, consult a medical professional. For benign causes, consider the following remedies:

- Cumin-coriander-fennel tea: Mix equal amounts, steep 1 teaspoon in hot water for 5-10 minutes, and drink 2-3 times a day.
- Punarnava guggulu: Take 1 tablet twice a day.
- Mixture of Vidari and Ashwagandha: Take ½ teaspoon 2-3 times a day with warm water.

## Other Helpful Remedies:

Oil Massage: Apply castor oil or sesame oil to the perineum area with gentle circular motions towards the base of the penis.

Yoga Tradition: Perform Ashwini Mudra by pulling the anus inward in tense-release movements. Do 10 repetitions morning and evening. Kukutasana pose can also be beneficial for prostate problems.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts
- Cumin 1 part
- Raw natural sugar 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot milk, and drink it once or twice a day until the condition is healed.

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.
- Avoid hard physical labor if possible.
- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

... (Additional content truncated for brevity) ...
Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.
- For stomachache with diarrhea, apply fresh ginger juice around the belly button.
- Try the Ayurvedic herb shankavati or lasunadivati for stomachache relief.
- Indian celery seed (ajwan) mixed with baking soda can also help alleviate stomachache.
- Roasted fennel, cumin, and coriander seed mixture can be chewed for relief.
- For indigestion, consume fresh onion juice with honey and black pepper.

Remember to consult a physician for severe stomach issues and consider these natural remedies for mild stomach discomfort.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Stress Relief

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sunburn

Here are some ayurvedic home remedies for treating sunburn:

- Take a gauze pad, dip it into cool milk (cow’s milk or goat’s milk), and apply it directly to the sunburn. If milk is not available, use a cloth dipped in cool water.
- Apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) topically.
- Pulverize some lettuce and apply the pulp directly to the sunburn.
- Place an icebag or a bag of frozen food on the affected area to cool the skin. Do not leave ice touching your skin for more than a minute or two without a break.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

## Teeth and Gum Care

You may find powders for the teeth made out of finely ground, roasted almond shells which are beneficial for maintaining good dental health.

Using Tea Tree Oil for Receding Gums and Sensitive Teeth:

- To treat bacterial infection in the roots of the teeth causing receding gums and sensitivity, brush teeth with tea tree oil and apply to gums.
- Applying tea tree oil to dental floss can help reach deep pockets of infection.

Chew Well: Chewing food well not only aids digestion but also stimulates the gums.

Try Figs: Eating and chewing figs daily can help strengthen teeth and gums.

Tap Your Teeth: Gently tapping teeth together can stimulate energy meridians related to dental health.

## Tendinitis Relief

Tendinitis can result from strenuous sports or repetitive non-strenuous activities. Here are some remedies:

For Mild Conditions:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gentle Stretching

Careful, gentle stretching of the affected muscles will gradually help to improve circulation and heal the pain and inflammation.

## Take Anti-Inflammatory Herbs

Taking some anti-inflammatory herbs will accelerate healing. Make this formula:

- kaishore guggulu 2 parts
- manjistha 2 parts
- musta 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

## For Acute or Chronic Conditions

Apply Heat: For both acute tendinitis and chronic tendinitis, apply soothing heat such as a liniment or a warm water compress to minimize pain or inflammation.

Oil Massage: Gently massage the affected area with mahanarayan oil and soak it in warm water.

## Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ears)

Herbal Remedies: According to Ayurveda, ringing in the ear is a vata disorder. To alleviate this root cause, prepare a tea made from equal amounts of comfrey, cinnamon, and chamomile. Drink 2 or 3 times a day.

- Take yogaraj guggulu (200 mg. 2 or 3 times a day) with warm water after food.
- Gently rub the mastoid bone with warm sesame oil twice a day for a week.
- Place 3 drops of garlic oil into your ear at night before bed.

Refer to the appendix for more information on preparing oils like garlic oil.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

## Douche for Vaginal Yeast Infection

If the yeast infection is vaginal, you will find it helpful to douche with licorice tea. Follow these steps:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of licorice powder in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.

NOTE: If you have a thick discharge from the genitals, along with an itching and burning sensation, it will be better to do the douche with triphala tea instead of licorice. Use the same procedure: take 1 tablespoon of triphala, boil it in a pint of water, cool, strain, and use the tea as a douche.

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

# Gems and Stones

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

# Ayurvedic Gemstones and their Benefits

# Ayurvedic Gemstones and their Benefits

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

## Emerald

This powerful precious stone brings prosperity and spiritual awakening. It calms vata and pitta, settles the nervous system, and relieves nervousness. Symbolic of the planet Mercury, emeralds improve writing skills, enhance the power of speech, and promote intelligence. They are best set in gold and worn on the little finger.

The doshic effects of diamonds vary according to their color. Red diamonds have a fiery energy that stimulates pitta; blue diamonds are cooling and calm pitta while increasing kapha. Clear, colorless diamonds calm pitta but increase both vata and kapha.

Symbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in relationships and are rightfully associated with marriage. These stones stimulate shukra, the body’s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this stone. Wear your diamond set in gold, either as a necklace or as a ring on the ring finger. But note: Diamonds of low quality may have negative effects upon the body.

## Red Coral

This gemstone from the sea represents the planet Mars. It calms pitta and helps one to control anger, hatred, and jealousy. Coral gives energy to the liver, spleen, and pericardium. Wear your red coral as a necklace or as a ring set in copper (preferably), silver, or white gold and worn on the ring finger. Red coral is strength-giving and imparts gracefulness.

## Opal

This semiprecious stone represents the planet Neptune. It strengthens majja dhatu (bone marrow and nerves) as well as shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue). It improves vision, relieves fever, calms pitta, and is good for migraine headaches. Opals enhance spiritual feelings, increase devotion, and help to unfold intuition. This gem is particularly beneficial for individuals with Neptune in their third, fourth, sixth, tenth, or twelfth astrological house. It should be set in gold or silver and worn on the ring finger.

## Cat’s-Eye

This stone is good for allergies, repeated colds and congestion, and allergic asthma. It pacifies kapha and vata while slightly increasing pitta. It aids in healing kidney dysfunction. Cat’s-eye enhances awareness and helps a person not get caught up in emotions. People working in psychological healing should wear this stone in a gold setting on their ring or little finger; it will help protect them from negative influences.

## Quartz Crystals

## Onyx

This stone is excellent for vata disorders. It is good for old age, debilitating disorders, and neurological dysfunction, and it helps with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and even schizophrenia. It induces quiet, deep sleep yet combats lethargy. It is good for memory and promotes positive thinking. Onyx makes life peaceful and happy and enhances love in relationships. It has energy vibrations that are Sun-like and Jupiter-like. This stone should be set in silver and worn on the ring finger. (If your Sun sign is in Sagittarius or Gemini, it is better not to wear this stone.)

## Jade

Jade is beneficial for longevity. It strengthens kidney energy and is reputed to bestow success upon its wearer. This stone is also good for the power of speech. It helps to prevent cataracts and is strengthening for the prostate. Wear a jade ring set in silver, on your little finger.

## Amethyst

Amethyst is a stone for the crown chakra and is good for mental clarity. To bring prosperity, it should be set in gold. You can also wear it around the neck on a gold necklace. A person with neuromuscular weakness can be helped by wearing amethysts and by putting them at the four corners of the bed. Some amethysts have a darker color, which gives them a Saturn-like energy similar to blue sapphire. Amethysts bestow dignity, love, compassion, and hope. This gem helps the individual to control emotions and is good for vata and pitta imbalance.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. Each illness is approached holistically, taking into account the individual's dosha constitution and overall health.

### Red

Red is a warming and stimulating color. It can relieve aggravated Vata and reduce excess Kapha. However, overexposure to red may aggravate Pitta and lead to inflammatory ailments. Red stimulates the formation of red blood cells, improves circulation, and gives energy to nerve tissue and bone marrow.

### Orange

Orange is a warming color with healing energy. It is sexually stimulating and provides energy to the sex organs. Orange is balancing to Vata and Kapha but may aggravate Pitta. It has antibacterial properties and hinders the growth of bacteria.

### Yellow

Yellow relieves excess Vata and Kapha. It promotes understanding, intelligence, and spiritual realization. Yellow acts as a decongestant and antibacterial. Overexposure to yellow may increase Pitta dosha.

### Green

Green has a calming effect on the mind and body, creating a feeling of...

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

This appendix briefly explains the preparation of herbs and special remedies such as medicated oils and ghees and offers suggestions on their use. For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1
- 3 teaspoons of herb 2
- ¼ teaspoon of herb 3

If you are making a large batch for long-term use, you can measure in tablespoons. A 1- to 2-month supply will require 2.5 to 5.0 ounces of herbs, a palm-size quantity. Again,

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee. Lubricate the syringe tip with oil or ghee, insert it into the rectum, and release the clip to allow the fluid to enter. Hold the fluid for 10 minutes, then assume a hands-and-knees position to relax the colon. Massage the colon area lightly in a counterclockwise motion. Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

## Nasya

Nasya is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or fine powders. When self-administering nasya, dip your clean finger into the recommended oil or ghee, and gently massage the inside of your nostril before sniffing to draw the oil upward.

# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

Ayurveda is considered the mother of all healing systems, with its roots in ancient Indian texts and practices. It encompasses various branches such as pediatrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, surgery, and more. These branches have influenced modern medicine and healing modalities like massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture.

## The Wisdom of Charaka

Charaka, a renowned sage-physician and one of the founders of Ayurvedic medicine, emphasized the importance of approaching patients with love and light. He believed that true healing comes from a place of compassion and understanding.

### A Message of Love

This book is a labor of love, crafted with the intention of sharing valuable knowledge for self-healing and well-being. May the remedies and suggestions offered here serve as a guide on your journey to health and healing.

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

The five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth - form the basis of material creation and are present in all matter, including the human body.

### Space (Ether):

Space is universal, formless, and all-pervading. It is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. Psychologically, space provides freedom and peace but can also lead to feelings of emptiness and insecurity.

### Ayurvedic Remedies:

For remedies related to specific illnesses and imbalances, refer to the comprehensive A-Z guide provided in this book.

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three primary doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific elements and governs various bodily functions.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is characterized by the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with fire and water elements. It governs metabolism and digestion, as well as emotions and intellect.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha combines water and earth elements. It provides structure and stability to the body, as well as lubrication and immunity.

## Imbalance and Remedies

When a dosha is out of balance, it can lead to various physical and emotional ailments. Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal treatments.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This comprehensive guide provides information on a wide range of illnesses and their corresponding ayurvedic remedies. From common colds to chronic conditions, Ayurveda offers natural solutions for healing.

## Conclusion

By understanding the doshas and their characteristics, as well as incorporating ayurvedic practices into daily life, individuals can achieve optimal health and well-being.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of mind, body, and spirit to prevent and treat illnesses.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics that influence an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

### Vata Dosha

One of the main psychological qualities of vata individuals is readiness to change. They are often restless, quick-thinking, and creative. However, they may also experience instability and lack of grounding. Vata types tend to have dry skin, light body frames, and cold hands and feet.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are known for their intense focus, determination, and strong digestion. They can be competitive and ambitious, but may also be prone to anger and irritability when out of balance. Pitta types typically have a medium build, sharp intellect, and warm body temperature.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha types are characterized by their calm and nurturing nature. They are often patient, loving, and compassionate. However, they can also be prone to lethargy and weight gain when imbalanced.

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

## Seasons

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Governs movement, creativity, and communication.
- Pitta: Governs digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governs stability, strength, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Deposition or Infiltration

The aggravated dosha enters weak or defective organs or tissues, leading to pathological changes. Factors like trauma, genetic predisposition, and emotional stress can contribute to this.

### Manifestation

In this stage, signs and symptoms of the disease become apparent, and the person falls sick. Disease manifests in the area of the defective tissue.

### Cellular Deformity Leading to Structural Distortion

At this stage, the disease is fully developed, and structural changes occur. Complications may arise in other organs or tissues.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent disease.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues
6. Destruction (Bheda): Manifestation of signs and symptoms

Awareness and prevention play a key role in maintaining health according to Ayurveda. By understanding one's constitution and making mindful choices in diet and lifestyle, one can prevent the abnormal movement of doshas and promote normal functioning.

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

One of the key treatments in Ayurveda is Panchakarma, a five-procedure program aimed at detoxifying the body. The program includes preparatory methods like internal oleation with ghee, external oleation with oil massage and sweating, and specific actions to eliminate excess doshas and toxins.

Some of the procedures involved in Panchakarma include therapeutic vomiting (vamana), purgation or laxative therapy (virechana), medicated enema therapy (basti), nasal administration of medication (nasya), and purification of the blood (rakta moksha).

Ayurveda also offers other methods to remove toxins from the body based on the individual's strength and the severity of the disease.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls metabolism and digestion. An excess of Pitta can result in inflammation, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Influenced by the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs stability and structure. Imbalance in Kapha may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Panchakarma: A powerful cleansing procedure in Ayurveda that is tailored to each individual's constitution and medical condition. It requires close supervision and post-treatment support.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism. It is associated with intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is associated with strength and endurance.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for common health issues:

### Eye Care

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

For more detailed information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Dry, light, cold, and rough. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

Consult a qualified ayurvedic practitioner before trying any remedies mentioned in this book.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.
---
# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Meditation Technique for Inner Peace

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.

# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

## Double-Arrowed Attention (Witnessing)
---
# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

WITNESSING AWARENESS

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Sweet Taste

The sweet taste is present in foods such as rice, sugar, milk, wheat, dates, and maple syrup. It increases the vital essence of life and promotes growth of all seven dhatus. Proper use gives strength and longevity.

Benefits: Encourages the senses, improves complexion, promotes healthy skin, hair, and voice, relieves thirst and burning sensations, and promotes stability.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

Effects of Excess: Excessive use can cause thirst, hyperacidity, heartburn, ulcers, skin conditions, and acid pH imbalance in the body.

### Salty Taste

Examples include sea salt, rock salt, and kelp. Salt, when used moderately, relieves vata, increases pitta and kapha, promotes growth, and aids digestion.

Caution: Too much salt may lead to thickening of blood, hypertension, skin issues, water retention, and other health problems.

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body. Imbalance in the doshas can lead to various health issues.

## Effects of Tastes on the Doshas

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

You can alleviate some of the ill effects of these combinations by using spices and herbs in your cooking. A strong digestive fire can be

According to Ayurvedic tradition, food not only nourishes the body but also affects the mind and consciousness. The three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas - play a crucial role in our mental and physical well-being.

## Psychological Constitutions

Human temperaments are classified into three types - sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Each type has its own psychological and moral characteristics, influencing how individuals react to various aspects of life.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with qualities of air and space. Vata individuals tend to be creative, energetic, and enthusiastic.
- Pitta: Associated with qualities of fire and water. Pitta individuals are intelligent, focused, and determined.
- Kapha: Associated with qualities of earth and water. Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and compassionate.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. From common colds to digestive issues, Ayurveda offers natural solutions to promote healing and balance in the body.

## Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic Qualities

In Ayurveda, individuals are classified based on their predominant qualities:

- Sattvic: Individuals with sattvic qualities are loving, compassionate, and pure-minded. They tend to have good manners and positive behavior.
- Rajasic: Individuals with rajasic qualities are egoistic, ambitious, and competitive. They are driven by power and prestige.
- Tamasic: Individuals with tamasic qualities are inclined towards materialism, laziness, and possessiveness.

## Ayurvedic Food Classification

Ayurveda classifies food into three categories based on the mental qualities they promote:

- Sattvic Food: Light and healthy food that increases clarity of mind and promotes love and compassion.
- Rajasic Food: Tempting food that increases activity and agitation.
- Tamasic Food: Heavy and dulling food that creates depression and heaviness.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda categorizes foods into three main types based on their qualities:

- Sattvic Foods: These are pure, light, and nourishing foods that promote clarity and vitality. Examples include fruits, steamed vegetables, and fresh vegetable juice.
- Rajasic Foods: These are hot, spicy, and stimulating foods that can lead to agitation and temptation. Examples include salty crackers, potato chips, and heavily spiced foods.
- Tamasic Foods: These are heavy, dull, and depressing foods that induce deep sleep. Examples include dark meats, thick cheese, and stale food.

The doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - also exhibit qualities of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas:

- Sattva: Present in Pitta as knowledge, Vata as clarity, and Kapha as forgiveness.
- Tamas: Heavy and dull in Kapha, aggressive in Pitta, and causing confusion in Vata.
- Rajas: Active and hyper, mainly found in Vata and Pitta doshas.

Understanding the qualities of foods and their impact on the doshas can help maintain balance and harmony in the body.

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

Calming Tea: Make a tea using specific herbs:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Appetite, Low

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.
---
# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

## Herbal Formula for Healthy Lactation

To maintain healthy lactation, use the following herbal formula:

- kutki 2 parts
- shilajit 2 parts
- shatavari 3 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Mineral Supplements for Brittle Nails

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body.
- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.

# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

A handful of raisins every day, at least an hour after meals.

## Prunes

## Peaches

One or two peaches about an hour after meals.

## Eat More Fiber

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help keep the bowels regular. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are also high in fiber.

## Milk and Ghee

Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at bedtime is an effective and gentle means of relieving constipation, especially for vata and pitta constitutions.

## Castor Oil

Castor oil can be used for obstinate constipation. A remedy is to make ginger tea, add 2 teaspoons of castor oil, and drink it before bedtime. Adjust the dose as needed.

Suggestion: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends when you can stay home.

## Flaxseed

Boil 1 tablespoon of flaxseed in a cup of water at night for at least 2 to 3 minutes. Drink the whole cupful, including the tea and seeds.

## For Constipation in Children

## Constipation

Follow the vata-pacifying diet. Use a lot of fiber in your diet and drink 4 to 5 glasses of water a day. Regular exercise, such as walking or yoga, can also help prevent constipation.

For constipation during pregnancy, consider using sat isabgol (psyllium husks) with warm milk or a combination of hot milk and ghee for gentle laxative action. Avoid using triphala or castor oil during pregnancy.

## Cough

Ayurveda suggests that most coughs are caused by excess pitta or kapha in the bronchial tree. To manage a cough effectively, determine if it is dry (vata) or productive with mucus (kapha), or if pitta is involved.

## Dry Cough Remedies

For a dry cough or a cough without much mucus, try the following remedies:

- Eat a ripe banana with 1 teaspoon of honey and 2 pinches of ground black pepper 2-3 times a day.
- Chop a clove of garlic, boil it in a cup of milk, and add ¼ teaspoon turmeric to create garlic-turmeric milk for soothing and healing most types of cough.
- Chew ¼ teaspoon of ajwain mixed with 1 teaspoon of natural organic sugar.
- Make talisadi tea by mixing talisadi powder, licorice powder, and honey for an effective remedy.

## Productive Cough Remedies

For a productive or kapha cough, consider the following home remedies:

- Mix ¼ teaspoon of black pepper powder with 1 teaspoon of honey and consume it on a full stomach to relieve congestion and drive out the cough.
- Prepare a tea with ginger powder, clove, and cinnamon powder in boiled water for cough relief.
- If the cough persists, mix ground mustard and ginger powder with honey and eat slowly 2-3 times a day.

These ayurvedic remedies can help alleviate different types of cough effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, the doshas are the three energies that govern our physical and mental processes. They are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each person has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution and health.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Governed by air and ether, Vata controls movement and is associated with dryness, cold, and lightness.
- Pitta: Governed by fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism and is associated with heat and intensity.
- Kapha: Governed by water and earth, Kapha provides structure and stability and is associated with heaviness and solidity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Dandruff

Dandruff is often caused by poor circulation to the scalp, leading to dry and flaky skin. It can also be due to a deficiency of vitamin B-6 or an excess of Vata dosha. Remedies include massaging the scalp with neem oil and using egg white mixed with lime juice to provide protein to the scalp.

### Depression

NOTE: Depression is a serious medical condition that requires the supervision of a doctor. Ayurvedic remedies can be used in conjunction with medical treatment with approval and supervision. Symptoms of depression include loss of interest, sleep disturbances, anxiety, fatigue, poor appetite, and more. Ayurveda aims to bring balance to the body to help manage or eliminate depression.

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

For best results, follow this schedule:

- Week 1: Every day
- Week 2: Every 2 days
- Week 3: Every 3 days
- Week 4: Once

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

## Simple and Best Remedy for Irritated Eyes

Put a single drop of pure, genuine castor oil (without preservatives) into your eyes at bedtime. Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles of your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil from staining your sheets.

## Bloodshot Eyes Remedy

If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange juice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.

### Fainting and Dizziness

Additional information on fainting and dizziness remedies can be found in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

Combine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and...

### Important Note

This liver-flushing treatment should not be done without the approval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an Ayurvedic physician to avoid damaging the gallbladder and experiencing dangerous complications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.
---
# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

It is important to note that unhealthy hair may indicate poor absorption of minerals, affecting bone health. The health of hair and nails can reflect bone health.

## Proper Diet

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Jatamamsi Remedy for Hangover

Ingredients:

- Jatamamsi - 3 parts

Instructions:

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day. Put it on your tongue and wash down with warm water.

Additional Tips:

- Drinking coconut water is beneficial for a hangover.
- Using nasya with bhringaraj oil or brahmi ghee can be effective.
- The herbal compound tikta is an effective antidote for alcohol toxicity.

## Headaches in Ayurveda

Headaches in Ayurveda are classified based on doshas:

- Vata type: Occipital area or left side headaches due to vata imbalance.
- Pitta type: Temple area headaches due to excess pitta and acidic conditions.
- Kapha type: Frontal and nasal area headaches due to kapha imbalance.

Other causes of headaches in Ayurveda include ear problems, eye problems, food allergies, and poor sleeping positions.

Treatment in Ayurveda is specific to the individual's dosha imbalance and the root cause of the headache.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

5. Avoid spicy and oily foods that can trigger heartburn and acid reflux.

By incorporating these Ayurvedic home remedies into your routine, you can effectively manage heartburn and acid stomach issues naturally.

Control acid stomach with a pitta-pacifying diet. Avoid hot spicy food, pickles, fermented food, citrus fruit, sour fruit, and overeating.

## Time to See the Doctor

If heartburn persists or occurs frequently without reason, consult a doctor. Seek immediate help if heartburn is accompanied by vomiting, dizziness, chest pain, neck or shoulder pain, or shortness of breath as it may indicate a heart attack.

## Soothing Breathing Exercise

Practice shitali pranayama, a breathing technique that cools the body, combats excess pitta, and stimulates digestion.

## Hemorrhoids

According to Ayurveda, there are two types of hemorrhoids:

### Vata Hemorrhoids

Characterized by being small, dry, irregular in shape, and may have fissures. They are hard to the touch and may become active due to antibiotics or physical exercise.

### Pitta Hemorrhoids

These hemorrhoids are red, irritated, inflamed, and tend to bleed. They are painful to the touch and may look like purple grapes. Bursting can lead to extensive bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

### Time to See the Doctor:

There are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, uremic hiccups, and cerebral hiccups, which require medical attention.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

One effective Ayurvedic remedy for regulating blood pressure is a tea made from the following herbs:

- Jatamamsi - 2 parts
- Musta - 2 parts
- Tagar - 1 part

Steep ½ teaspoon of the herb mixture in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drink the tea after lunch and dinner.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Keep Cool: Avoid working hard under the hot sun if you have high blood pressure to prevent promoting hemorrhage in the brain.

Magnetic Water: Drink magnetic water by placing a cup of water next to the north pole of a magnet for 2 hours. Drink a cupful of magnetic water twice a day to help control blood pressure.

Rudraksha: Soak 1 or 2 rudraksha beads in a cup of water overnight and drink the water the next day to regulate blood pressure.

## Deep Relaxation to Help High Blood Pressure

Tension and stress can increase high blood pressure. Try the yogic rest pose, savasana, for deep relaxation:

Lie flat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the flow of your breath and practice quiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes. This natural antidote for hypertension can help you relax.

Meditation: Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure and can be as effective as medications in controlling hypertension without negative side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

## Preventing Adult-Onset Diabetes

Ingredients:

- Shilajit - 1 part
- Shardunika - 1 part

Instructions: Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture after lunch and dinner with some water.

### Yoga Postures

Some yoga asanas to strengthen the pancreas and help prevent hypoglycemia include the Peacock, Camel, and Locust poses, and the Elevated Lotus, as well as nauli (an abdominal exercise explained in appendix 3). Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia should do these yoga exercises and Alternate Nostril breathing.

### Nasya

Brahmi ghee nasya, 5 drops in each nostril, will quickly relieve nausea, sweating, and mental confusion (see appendix 3).

### For Drowsiness

Drowsiness can be corrected by taking some sweet juice, such as pomegranate or sweet orange juice.

## Impotence Remedies

Impotence, which is a man’s inability to have or to maintain an erection, may have several causes. It can be due to emotional, psychological issues, stress, or certain physical problems.

Massage to Improve Circulation: Massage the pubic area and the root of the penis with a few drops of mahanarayan oil to improve circulation and potentially eliminate the problem.

Apply Herbalized Oil: Apply bala oil or ashwagandha oil directly to the penis.

Massage the Prostate Area: Massaging above the prostate gland with the mentioned oils or plain ghee can be beneficial for improving circulation.

## Strengthening Herbal Formula

For internal use, make a mixture of equal proportions of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day in warm milk, continuing for 3 months. Add chopped fresh garlic to the warm milk to improve blood supply and vessel dilation.

## Mild Aphrodisiac Drink

Every night, drink a cup of warm milk with a pinch of saffron added. Saffron is an aphrodisiac and increases sperm count.

## Relax with Tranquillity Tea

If impotence is psychological, try Tranquillity Tea containing jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi in equal proportions. Drink ½ teaspoon of this mixture before bed to alleviate emotional stress.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga poses like Rooster pose, Elevated Lotus, Vajrasana, Chakra Asana, and Bow pose to help with impotence. Refer to illustrations in appendix 4.

## Indigestion

The effectiveness of digestion depends on the strength of your digestive fire (agni). Avoid heavy, liquid, or dense food intake that can inhibit agni. Emotional eating and wrong food combining can also lead to indigestion.

For more information, refer to the chapter on "Urinary Incontinence" in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Kidney Issues

## Congestion, High Pitta, or Crystal Urea in the Kidney

Congestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all create tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests the following simple remedies:

### Herbal Mixture

Prepare a mixture of the following herbs:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Gokshura - 1 part
- Fennel seed - 1 part

Take 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it down with warm water.

### Cumin-Coriander-Fennel Tea

Prepare a tea by mixing equal amounts of cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds. Boil in water and drink 2 or 3 times a day. (Use about ¼ teaspoon of each herb per cup of water.)

### Ayurvedic Herb Drink

Combine about ½ teaspoon of musta with ½ teaspoon of fennel. Steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.

## Kidney Stones

There are different types of kidney stones corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha dosha:

- Calcium stones (kapha stones)
- Phosphate stones
- Oxalate stones (pitta stones)

### Herbal Remedies

If you already have a kidney stone, Ayurveda suggests Punarnava Guggulu and Gokshuradi Guggulu. Take one tablet of each twice a day after lunch and dinner.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Migraine Headaches

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

- Avoid feeding the child’s imagination with disturbing images.
- Engage children in creative play and avoid violent or horrifying TV programs or stories.
- Create a pleasant environment in the child's room with sweet music and tinkling bells.
- Tell positive and uplifting stories to children.
- Give the child a mini-oil massage before bed using brahmi oil or bhringaraj oil.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and body temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of water and earth. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by thinning and increasing porosity of the bones, often due to increased Vata dosha. It is more common in women, especially after menopause, due to hormonal changes.

Remedies:

- Engage in gentle, daily exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Walking, swimming, or gentle jogging are recommended.
- Include weight-bearing exercises cautiously, especially if diagnosed with osteoporosis, to avoid the risk of fractures.
- Ensure a diet rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other nutrients essential for bone health.

By following these remedies and making lifestyle changes, individuals can manage osteoporosis effectively and improve bone health over time.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

Food nourishes the body; love nourishes the soul. Overeating can be caused by emotional factors such as loneliness, grief, sadness, or depression. In Ayurveda, overeating is linked to prana vata stimulating jatharagni, leading to increased hunger.

## Ways to Deal with Overeating:

1. Express Your Feelings: Write about your feelings to release blocked energy in the solar plexus.
2. Meditate and Breathe: Practice So-Hum meditation or Shitali pranayama to reduce emotional hunger.
3. Yoga: Practice specific yoga exercises like Moon Salutation, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Spinal Twist to control overeating.
4. Walk Off the Cravings: Take a brisk walk for 20 minutes to reduce emotional cravings for food.
5. Eat Lightly: Opt for light foods like crackers, millet, rye, or fruit juice to satisfy hunger without gaining weight.
6. Try Bananas: Eating a ripe banana with ghee and cardamom can help pacify emotional eating habits.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle changes, overeating due to emotional factors can be effectively managed.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Test Your Hunger

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

- Vata type is characterized by low backache, lower abdominal pain, distention, anxiety, fear, insomnia, and mood swings.
- Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, urethritis, hives, hot flashes, irritability, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.
- Kapha-type PMS involves water retention (breasts become enlarged and tender) and drowsiness, so that the woman loves to drink coffee!

PMS can be cared for successfully using the following Ayurvedic remedies and...

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Effective Herbs

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Formula:

Make a formula using the following Ayurvedic herbs:

- Punarnava - 2 parts
- Shilajit - ⅛ part
- Gokshura - 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of the mixture twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water. Continue until symptoms resolve.

## Teas for Relief:

You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea for relief. Follow the directions on the package or use bulk herbs by adding about 1 teaspoon of mixture to a cup of boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, cool, and drink.

## Time to See the Doctor:

If prostate cancer is a possible diagnosis, consult a medical professional. For benign causes, consider the following remedies:

- Cumin-coriander-fennel tea: Mix equal amounts, steep 1 teaspoon in hot water for 5-10 minutes, and drink 2-3 times a day.
- Punarnava guggulu: Take 1 tablet twice a day.
- Mixture of Vidari and Ashwagandha: Take ½ teaspoon 2-3 times a day with warm water.

## Other Helpful Remedies:

Oil Massage: Apply castor oil or sesame oil to the perineum area with gentle circular motions towards the base of the penis.

Yoga Tradition: Perform Ashwini Mudra by pulling the anus inward in tense-release movements. Do 10 repetitions morning and evening. Kukutasana pose can also be beneficial for prostate problems.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts
- Cumin 1 part
- Raw natural sugar 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot milk, and drink it once or twice a day until the condition is healed.

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.
- Avoid hard physical labor if possible.
- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

... (Additional content truncated for brevity) ...
Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.
- For stomachache with diarrhea, apply fresh ginger juice around the belly button.
- Try the Ayurvedic herb shankavati or lasunadivati for stomachache relief.
- Indian celery seed (ajwan) mixed with baking soda can also help alleviate stomachache.
- Roasted fennel, cumin, and coriander seed mixture can be chewed for relief.
- For indigestion, consume fresh onion juice with honey and black pepper.

Remember to consult a physician for severe stomach issues and consider these natural remedies for mild stomach discomfort.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

Find the right match between your job and your personality. Job stress can be a burden when work and personality are not appropriately matched. Discover your true role and goal to reduce stress.

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

## Medicated Nose Drops

Try nasya with brahmi ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee into each nostril for relief. Refer to the nasya instructions for proper usage.

## Stress-Reducing Tea

Prepare a relaxing tea using herbs like chamomile, comfrey, angelica, or brahmi. These teas can help manage stress when consumed 2-3 times a day.

## Yoga Stretching

Practice specific asanas like Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose for stress management. The Lion pose is also effective in relieving stress.

## Meditation

Sit in the Lotus pose or Easy pose, facing east, and meditate. Focus on your breath or try the So-Hum meditation for stress relief.

## Breathe Away Stress

Practice Ujjayi pranayama for calming effects. You can do this breathing exercise sitting up or lying down in Savasana for stress relief.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

Herbal Remedies: According to Ayurveda, ringing in the ear is a vata disorder. To alleviate this root cause, prepare a tea made from equal amounts of comfrey, cinnamon, and chamomile. Drink 2 or 3 times a day.

- Take yogaraj guggulu (200 mg. 2 or 3 times a day) with warm water after food.
- Gently rub the mastoid bone with warm sesame oil twice a day for a week.
- Place 3 drops of garlic oil into your ear at night before bed.

Refer to the appendix for more information on preparing oils like garlic oil.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

## Douche for Vaginal Yeast Infection

If the yeast infection is vaginal, you will find it helpful to douche with licorice tea. Follow these steps:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of licorice powder in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.

NOTE: If you have a thick discharge from the genitals, along with an itching and burning sensation, it will be better to do the douche with triphala tea instead of licorice. Use the same procedure: take 1 tablespoon of triphala, boil it in a pint of water, cool, strain, and use the tea as a douche.

# Ayurveda Conclusion

# Conclusion

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

# Gems and Stones

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

# Ayurvedic Gemstones and their Benefits

# Ayurvedic Gemstones and their Benefits

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. Each illness is approached holistically, taking into account the individual's dosha constitution and overall health.

### Red

Red is a warming and stimulating color. It can relieve aggravated Vata and reduce excess Kapha. However, overexposure to red may aggravate Pitta and lead to inflammatory ailments. Red stimulates the formation of red blood cells, improves circulation, and gives energy to nerve tissue and bone marrow.

### Orange

Orange is a warming color with healing energy. It is sexually stimulating and provides energy to the sex organs. Orange is balancing to Vata and Kapha but may aggravate Pitta. It has antibacterial properties and hinders the growth of bacteria.

### Yellow

Yellow relieves excess Vata and Kapha. It promotes understanding, intelligence, and spiritual realization. Yellow acts as a decongestant and antibacterial. Overexposure to yellow may increase Pitta dosha.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

This appendix briefly explains the preparation of herbs and special remedies such as medicated oils and ghees and offers suggestions on their use. For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1
- 3 teaspoons of herb 2
- ¼ teaspoon of herb 3

If you are making a large batch for long-term use, you can measure in tablespoons. A 1- to 2-month supply will require 2.5 to 5.0 ounces of herbs, a palm-size quantity. Again,

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee.

Hold the fluid for 10 minutes, then assume a hands-and-knees position to relax the colon. Massage the colon area lightly in a counterclockwise motion. Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

## Nasya

Nasya is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or fine powders. When self-administering nasya, dip your clean finger into the recommended oil or ghee, and gently massage the inside of your nostril before sniffing to draw the oil upward.

# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

The five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth - form the basis of material creation and are present in all matter, including the human body.

### Space (Ether):

Space is universal, formless, and all-pervading. It is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. Psychologically, space provides freedom and peace but can also lead to feelings of emptiness and insecurity.

### Ayurvedic Remedies:

For remedies related to specific illnesses and imbalances, refer to the comprehensive A-Z guide provided in this book.

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics that influence an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

One of the main psychological qualities of vata individuals is readiness to change. They are often restless, quick-thinking, and creative. However, they may also experience instability and lack of grounding. Vata types tend to have dry skin, light body frames, and cold hands and feet.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are known for their intense focus, determination, and strong digestion. They can be competitive and ambitious, but may also be prone to anger and irritability when out of balance. Pitta types typically have a medium build, sharp intellect, and warm body temperature.

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.
---
# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

For Kapha individuals, winter and early spring can be challenging times when imbalances may lead to physical, emotional, and mental issues. It is important to address these imbalances through diet, lifestyle, and exercise.

Kapha women may experience PMS symptoms like excessive emotionality and water retention. It is recommended for them to stay active, avoid heavy foods, and maintain a balanced routine to manage these symptoms.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

### LIKE INCREASES LIKE

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

## Seasons

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues
6. Destruction (Bheda): Manifestation of signs and symptoms

Awareness and prevention play a key role in maintaining health according to Ayurveda. By understanding one's constitution and making mindful choices in diet and lifestyle, one can prevent the abnormal movement of doshas and promote normal functioning.

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, constipation, and insomnia.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and indigestion.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may cause congestion, lethargy, and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Home remedies in Ayurveda aim not only to treat the symptoms but also to purify the body and prevent future diseases. Rejuvenation and rebuilding are essential aspects of Ayurvedic healing.

### Schedule for Home Panchakarma

Here is an ideal schedule for your home panchakarma purification treatment:

|Day|Internal|External|Oil Bath|Basti|Your Doshic Diet|Diet|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Monday|Monodiet Kitchari|Kitchari with steamed vegetables|Coriander/cumin/fennel tea| | | |

### Rejuvenation and Rebuilding

The purpose of panchakarma is not just to get well but to purify and strengthen the body for long-term health. Rejuvenatives like rasayanas promote renewal and longevity at the cellular level.

#### Rejuvenative Herbs

- Vata: Ashwagandha in hot milk twice a day.
- Pitta: Shatavari in warm milk twice a day.
- Kapha: Punarnava in warm water twice a day.

Herbal mixtures like chyavanprash can also be used to tonify the system and enhance overall health.

### Three Cautions About Home Panchakarma

1. Panchakarma, even in a gentle home program, has a powerful effect.

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism. It is associated with intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is associated with strength and endurance.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for common health issues:

### Eye Care

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

For more detailed information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.

# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA (HUMMING BREATH)

When doing bhramari, touch the tip of your tongue lightly to the edge of the soft palate near the back of the roof of your mouth. Be sure the teeth are not clenched.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Meditation Technique for Inner Peace

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.

# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

## Double-Arrowed Attention (Witnessing)
---
# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

WITNESSING AWARENESS

Object - Me

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

You can alleviate some of the ill effects of these combinations by using spices and herbs in your cooking. A strong digestive fire can be

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

These remedies can help balance emotions and control anger and hostility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

Calming Tea: Make a tea using specific herbs:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Appetite, Low

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.
---
# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Boil Remedies

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

## Herbal Formula for Healthy Lactation

To maintain healthy lactation, use the following herbal formula:

- kutki 2 parts
- shilajit 2 parts
- shatavari 3 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Mineral Supplements for Brittle Nails

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body.
- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.
---
# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, the doshas are the three energies that govern our physical and mental processes. They are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each person has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution and health.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Kapha: Governed by water and earth, Kapha provides structure and stability and is associated with heaviness and solidity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Dandruff

Dandruff is often caused by poor circulation to the scalp, leading to dry and flaky skin. It can also be due to a deficiency of vitamin B-6 or an excess of Vata dosha. Remedies include massaging the scalp with neem oil and using egg white mixed with lime juice to provide protein to the scalp.

### Depression

NOTE: Depression is a serious medical condition that requires the supervision of a doctor. Ayurvedic remedies can be used in conjunction with medical treatment with approval and supervision. Symptoms of depression include loss of interest, sleep disturbances, anxiety, fatigue, poor appetite, and more. Ayurveda aims to bring balance to the body to help manage or eliminate depression.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

For best results, follow this schedule:

- Week 1: Every day
- Week 2: Every 2 days
- Week 3: Every 3 days
- Week 4: Once

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

Use collyrium (kajal) made of castor oil and natural camphor to soothe and strengthen your eyes. Apply sparingly to the inner edge of the eyelid.

## Stress Reducer

To ease eyestrain, dip a cotton ball in cool goat's milk and place it over your closed eyes to reduce stress and improve eye comfort.

### Additional Suggestions

- Read sitting up with a straight vertebral column to avoid strain.
- Use a non-glare computer screen or a protecting filter to reduce eye strain from screen glare.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

Combine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and...

### Important Note

This liver-flushing treatment should not be done without the approval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an Ayurvedic physician to avoid damaging the gallbladder and experiencing dangerous complications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.
---
# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

It is important to note that unhealthy hair may indicate poor absorption of minerals, affecting bone health. The health of hair and nails can reflect bone health.

## Proper Diet

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

Additional Tips:

- Drinking coconut water is beneficial for a hangover.
- Using nasya with bhringaraj oil or brahmi ghee can be effective.
- The herbal compound tikta is an effective antidote for alcohol toxicity.

## Headaches in Ayurveda

Headaches in Ayurveda are classified based on doshas:

- Vata type: Occipital area or left side headaches due to vata imbalance.
- Pitta type: Temple area headaches due to excess pitta and acidic conditions.
- Kapha type: Frontal and nasal area headaches due to kapha imbalance.

Other causes of headaches in Ayurveda include ear problems, eye problems, food allergies, and poor sleeping positions.

Treatment in Ayurveda is specific to the individual's dosha imbalance and the root cause of the headache.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Vata-Type Headaches

Vata-type headaches are located in the back (occipital) portion of the head. They are characterized by throbbing, pulsating pain that radiates from the back of the head to the front. These headaches may be associated with tension in the neck and shoulder muscles, back stiffness, constipation, and sciatica. Vata headaches are aggravated by high altitude and worsen with movement but subside with rest.

### Remedies:

- Warm Water Enema: Use a warm water enema to relieve constipation and detoxify the colon over several weeks.
- Oil Enema (Basti): Administer warm sesame oil enema to calm vata.
- Oil Massage: Massage neck and shoulder muscles with sesame oil followed by a hot shower.
- Ghee Nasya: Put warm ghee drops in each nostril to reduce vata and soothe the headache.
- Nighttime Foot and Scalp Massage: Apply sesame oil on the head and feet before sleep.
- Dehydration Correction: Address dehydration with homemade dextrosaline solution.
- Soothing Paste: Apply nutmeg paste on the forehead to soothe the headache.
- Vata-Balancing Diet: Follow a vata-pacifying diet if prone to vata headaches.

## Pitta-Type Headaches

Pitta-type headaches start in the temple area and move to the central part of the head. They are characterized by shooting, burning pain worsened by bright light, hot sun, high temperatures, and certain foods. Nausea may accompany pitta headaches.

### Remedies:

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

5. Avoid spicy and oily foods that can trigger heartburn and acid reflux.

By incorporating these Ayurvedic home remedies into your routine, you can effectively manage heartburn and acid stomach issues naturally.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

### Time to See the Doctor:

There are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, uremic hiccups, and cerebral hiccups, which require medical attention.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

One effective Ayurvedic remedy for regulating blood pressure is a tea made from the following herbs:

- Jatamamsi - 2 parts
- Musta - 2 parts
- Tagar - 1 part

Steep ½ teaspoon of the herb mixture in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drink the tea after lunch and dinner.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Keep Cool: Avoid working hard under the hot sun if you have high blood pressure to prevent promoting hemorrhage in the brain.

Magnetic Water: Drink magnetic water by placing a cup of water next to the north pole of a magnet for 2 hours. Drink a cupful of magnetic water twice a day to help control blood pressure.

Rudraksha: Soak 1 or 2 rudraksha beads in a cup of water overnight and drink the water the next day to regulate blood pressure.

## Deep Relaxation to Help High Blood Pressure

Tension and stress can increase high blood pressure. Try the yogic rest pose, savasana, for deep relaxation:

Lie flat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the flow of your breath and practice quiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes. This natural antidote for hypertension can help you relax.

Meditation: Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure and can be as effective as medications in controlling hypertension without negative side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

### Yoga Postures

Some yoga asanas to strengthen the pancreas and help prevent hypoglycemia include the Peacock, Camel, and Locust poses, and the Elevated Lotus, as well as nauli (an abdominal exercise explained in appendix 3). Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia should do these yoga exercises and Alternate Nostril breathing.

### Nasya

Brahmi ghee nasya, 5 drops in each nostril, will quickly relieve nausea, sweating, and mental confusion (see appendix 3).

### For Drowsiness

Drowsiness can be corrected by taking some sweet juice, such as pomegranate or sweet orange juice.

## Impotence Remedies

Impotence, which is a man’s inability to have or to maintain an erection, may have several causes. It can be due to emotional, psychological issues, stress, or certain physical problems.

Massage to Improve Circulation: Massage the pubic area and the root of the penis with a few drops of mahanarayan oil to improve circulation and potentially eliminate the problem.

Apply Herbalized Oil: Apply bala oil or ashwagandha oil directly to the penis.

Massage the Prostate Area: Massaging above the prostate gland with the mentioned oils or plain ghee can be beneficial for improving circulation.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga poses like Rooster pose, Elevated Lotus, Vajrasana, Chakra Asana, and Bow pose to help with impotence. Refer to illustrations in appendix 4.

## Indigestion

The effectiveness of digestion depends on the strength of your digestive fire (agni). Avoid heavy, liquid, or dense food intake that can inhibit agni. Emotional eating and wrong food combining can also lead to indigestion.

For more information, refer to the chapter on "Urinary Incontinence" in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

Combine about ½ teaspoon of musta with ½ teaspoon of fennel. Steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.

## Kidney Stones

There are different types of kidney stones corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha dosha:

- Calcium stones (kapha stones)
- Phosphate stones
- Oxalate stones (pitta stones)

### Herbal Remedies

If you already have a kidney stone, Ayurveda suggests Punarnava Guggulu and Gokshuradi Guggulu. Take one tablet of each twice a day after lunch and dinner.

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

## Fruit Fast for Memory Enhancement

A fruit fast can be beneficial for memory improvement as it helps in detoxifying the body and enhancing mental clarity. However, it should be avoided by individuals prone to hypoglycemia. Recommended fruits for the fast based on doshas:

- For Vata: Papayas, prunes, mangoes
- For Pitta: Grapes, pomegranates, apples
- For Kapha: Apples, cranberries, pomegranates

## Other Foods for Memory Improvement

In addition to fruits, certain foods can help in improving memory. Foods like sweet potatoes, tapioca, okra, and spinach are beneficial. Sattvic foods, including fresh fruits, vegetables, almonds, oranges, ghee, and milk, are good for memory enhancement. Avoid heavy meats if you have memory issues.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

- Ginkgo and Gotu Kola: These herbs improve memory by increasing circulation to the brain.
- Medhya Herbs: Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Bhringaraj, and Shanka Pushpi are specific herbs that improve memory. You can make a tea by steeping these herbs in hot water and drink it twice a day for a month.
- Brahmi Milk: Boil Brahmi in milk and drink it at bedtime for remarkable memory improvement. Add saffron for additional benefits.

Consistent use of these herbs and practices can help in enhancing memory and cognitive function over time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and memory problems.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta imbalance may manifest as inflammation and irritability.

Kapha: Comprised of earth and water elements, Kapha provides structure and stability. Imbalance can result in lethargy and congestion.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Memory Problems

Memory problems can be caused by stress and anxiety. Regular meditation, such as the Empty Bowl or So-Hum meditation, can help relieve stress and improve memory.

Avoiding toxic substances like alcohol, marijuana, and certain drugs is crucial for maintaining good memory function. Nicotine toxicity from smoking can also impact memory negatively.

### Menopause Problems

Menopause is a natural phase in a woman's life marked by hormonal changes. Following a vata-pacifying diet and incorporating aloe vera gel and mineral supplements can help alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings.

### Natural Hormone Sources

Consider incorporating natural sources of hormones like aloe vera gel and mineral supplements containing calcium, magnesium, and zinc to support hormonal balance during menopause.

## Menopausal Women

It has become commonplace for modern medicine to prescribe hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women. Ayurveda recommends female rejuvenating herbs like shatavari and wild yam to prevent and alleviate menopausal symptoms. These herbs provide natural food precursors of estrogen and progesterone.

Try a mixture of vidari or wild yam and shatavari twice a day after lunch and dinner during menopause. This can help with symptoms like hot flashes and prevent osteoporosis.

## Hot Flashes

For hot flashes, drink a cup of pomegranate juice with rock candy powder or organic sugar and lime juice 2-3 times a day as needed.

## Vaginal Dryness

To alleviate vaginal dryness, insert a tampon-like shape cotton soaked in sesame oil into the vagina at night. Use a sanitary pad to catch any leakage.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga postures like Sun Salutation, Lotus, Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, Leg Lifts, and Chest-Knee pose to strengthen the lower abdominal area.

## Dysmenorrhea

According to Ayurveda, dysmenorrhea can be divided into three types: vata, pitta, and kapha. Identifying the specific type is crucial for effective treatment.

Kapha-type menstrual problems can be effectively treated by using a mixture of:

- punarnava ½ part
- manjistha ½ part
- trikatu ⅛ part

Take about ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, washed down with warm water.

Application of mustard oil and castor oil (half and half) to the lower abdomen will also help with kapha-type menstrual discomfort.

### Important Note

If self-treatment is not working or appears to be making the condition worse, reassess the situation and try a different line of treatment. Consult a trained Ayurvedic diagnostician if needed.

## For All Body Types

Herbal Remedies: Ayurvedic medicine includes powerful herbal compounds based on the herb guggulu. Choose the following based on your dosha:

- Vata-type pain: triphala guggulu or yogaraj guggulu

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

Perhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to prevent menstrual problems. You can follow this strategy quite easily, effectively, safely, and inexpensively.

ALOE VERA GEL: For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual pain and discomfort.

DIETARY GUIDELINES: Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

YOGA POSITIONS: Throughout the month, spend a few minutes every day on the yoga postures recommended for your body type. Yoga asanas are not recommended during the menstrual period. Just rest, read, and relax as much as possible.

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Migraine Headaches

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

## Preventing and Treating Muscle Cramps

Soak It: For a cramp in your foot, soak the foot in a bucket of warm water that contains salt (1 or 2 tablespoons).

Herbal Relaxants: Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, jatamamsi tea, or comfrey tea. You can also make a tea using equal amounts of all three herbs (⅓ teaspoon of each per cup) to relax your muscles.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

Warm Milk: Warm milk is helpful for abdominal muscle cramps due to its alkaline property and calcium content. Drinking one cup of warm milk at bedtime can help pacify acidity and relax muscles.

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Governs digestion and metabolism.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, soft, and cold. Governs structure and lubrication in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Nosebleeds

To stop nosebleeds, try using pomegranate nose drops by placing a few drops of fresh pomegranate juice in your nostrils. If the bleeding persists, consult a doctor as it could indicate an underlying health issue like high blood pressure or leukemia.

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet by avoiding hot and spicy foods, alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive sun exposure.

### Obesity

Obesity is a condition of excessive body fat accumulation that can lead to various health problems. It is primarily a Kapha disorder caused by overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and lack of exercise.

Factors contributing to obesity include hereditary issues, pregnancy weight gain, stress-induced eating, and certain medications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

Obesity is often caused by eating too much and not getting enough exercise. Factors such as consuming cold drinks, fatty fried foods, dairy products like cheese and ice cream, and excess sugar and carbohydrates can contribute to obesity.

## Watch Your Diet

Control what you eat by following a kapha-pacifying diet. Avoid cold drinks, fatty fried foods, and minimize dairy products. Include salads, beans, and drink hot water or herbal teas like ginger, mint, or cinnamon. Limit meat consumption to fish or chicken once a month.

## Get Adequate Exercise

Engage in regular exercise such as daily walks, aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming, and weight lifting with 5-pound weights. Remember that burning more calories than you consume is essential for weight loss.

## Post-Exercise Prescription

Avoid cold drinks and snacks after exercise. Opt for hot drinks like herbal teas to maintain a healthy metabolism.

## Eat Your Biggest Meal Early in the Day

Skip breakfast if possible, have a substantial meal at noon, and keep supper light. Avoid snacking between meals and consider skipping supper entirely.

## Drop Alcohol and Tobacco

Avoid alcohol and tobacco consumption as these habits can contribute to obesity.

## Listen to Music

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more, so that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and body temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of water and earth. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by thinning and increasing porosity of the bones, often due to increased Vata dosha. It is more common in women, especially after menopause, due to hormonal changes.

Remedies:

- Engage in gentle, daily exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Walking, swimming, or gentle jogging are recommended.
- Include weight-bearing exercises cautiously, especially if diagnosed with osteoporosis, to avoid the risk of fractures.
- Ensure a diet rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other nutrients essential for bone health.

By following these remedies and making lifestyle changes, individuals can manage osteoporosis effectively and improve bone health over time.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

Food nourishes the body; love nourishes the soul. Overeating can be caused by emotional factors such as loneliness, grief, sadness, or depression. In Ayurveda, overeating is linked to prana vata stimulating jatharagni, leading to increased hunger.

## Ways to Deal with Overeating:

1. Express Your Feelings: Write about your feelings to release blocked energy in the solar plexus.
2. Meditate and Breathe: Practice So-Hum meditation or Shitali pranayama to reduce emotional hunger.
3. Yoga: Practice specific yoga exercises like Moon Salutation, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Spinal Twist to control overeating.
4. Walk Off the Cravings: Take a brisk walk for 20 minutes to reduce emotional cravings for food.
5. Eat Lightly: Opt for light foods like crackers, millet, rye, or fruit juice to satisfy hunger without gaining weight.
6. Try Bananas: Eating a ripe banana with ghee and cardamom can help pacify emotional eating habits.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle changes, overeating due to emotional factors can be effectively managed.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Test Your Hunger

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

- Vata type is characterized by low backache, lower abdominal pain, distention, anxiety, fear, insomnia, and mood swings.
- Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, urethritis, hives, hot flashes, irritability, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.
- Kapha-type PMS involves water retention (breasts become enlarged and tender) and drowsiness, so that the woman loves to drink coffee!

PMS can be cared for successfully using the following Ayurvedic remedies and...

## Preventive Measures

IMPORTANT: In all cases, start the preventive program one week before the anticipated start of your period.

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Effective Herbs

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Formula:

Make a formula using the following Ayurvedic herbs:

- Punarnava - 2 parts
- Shilajit - ⅛ part
- Gokshura - 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of the mixture twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water. Continue until symptoms resolve.

## Teas for Relief:

You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea for relief. Follow the directions on the package or use bulk herbs by adding about 1 teaspoon of mixture to a cup of boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, cool, and drink.

## Time to See the Doctor:

If prostate cancer is a possible diagnosis, consult a medical professional. For benign causes, consider the following remedies:

- Cumin-coriander-fennel tea: Mix equal amounts, steep 1 teaspoon in hot water for 5-10 minutes, and drink 2-3 times a day.
- Punarnava guggulu: Take 1 tablet twice a day.
- Mixture of Vidari and Ashwagandha: Take ½ teaspoon 2-3 times a day with warm water.

## Other Helpful Remedies:

Oil Massage: Apply castor oil or sesame oil to the perineum area with gentle circular motions towards the base of the penis.

Yoga Tradition: Perform Ashwini Mudra by pulling the anus inward in tense-release movements. Do 10 repetitions morning and evening. Kukutasana pose can also be beneficial for prostate problems.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts
- Cumin 1 part
- Raw natural sugar 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot milk, and drink it once or twice a day until the condition is healed.

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.
- Avoid hard physical labor if possible.
- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.
- For stomachache with diarrhea, apply fresh ginger juice around the belly button.
- Try the Ayurvedic herb shankavati or lasunadivati for stomachache relief.
- Indian celery seed (ajwan) mixed with baking soda can also help alleviate stomachache.
- Roasted fennel, cumin, and coriander seed mixture can be chewed for relief.
- For indigestion, consume fresh onion juice with honey and black pepper.

Remember to consult a physician for severe stomach issues and consider these natural remedies for mild stomach discomfort.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Stress Relief

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

Find the right match between your job and your personality. Job stress can be a burden when work and personality are not appropriately matched. Discover your true role and goal to reduce stress.

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

## Medicated Nose Drops

Try nasya with brahmi ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee into each nostril for relief. Refer to the nasya instructions for proper usage.

## Stress-Reducing Tea

Prepare a relaxing tea using herbs like chamomile, comfrey, angelica, or brahmi. These teas can help manage stress when consumed 2-3 times a day.

## Yoga Stretching

Practice specific asanas like Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose for stress management. The Lion pose is also effective in relieving stress.

## Meditation

Sit in the Lotus pose or Easy pose, facing east, and meditate. Focus on your breath or try the So-Hum meditation for stress relief.

## Breathe Away Stress

Practice Ujjayi pranayama for calming effects. You can do this breathing exercise sitting up or lying down in Savasana for stress relief.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

## Douche for Vaginal Yeast Infection

If the yeast infection is vaginal, you will find it helpful to douche with licorice tea. Follow these steps:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of licorice powder in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.

NOTE: If you have a thick discharge from the genitals, along with an itching and burning sensation, it will be better to do the douche with triphala tea instead of licorice. Use the same procedure: take 1 tablespoon of triphala, boil it in a pint of water, cool, strain, and use the tea as a douche.

# Ayurveda Conclusion

# Conclusion

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

## Emerald

This powerful precious stone brings prosperity and spiritual awakening. It calms vata and pitta, settles the nervous system, and relieves nervousness. Symbolic of the planet Mercury, emeralds improve writing skills, enhance the power of speech, and promote intelligence. They are best set in gold and worn on the little finger.

This very powerful gemstone combats premature aging, enhances the span of life, and strengthens immunity. Its energy brings subtle energy vibrations to the heart, brain, and deeper bodily tissues. It is the best stone for rejuvenation. It brings prosperity and is spiritually uplifting.

The doshic effects of diamonds vary according to their color. Red diamonds have a fiery energy that stimulates pitta; blue diamonds are cooling and calm pitta while increasing kapha. Clear, colorless diamonds calm pitta but increase both vata and kapha.

Symbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in relationships and are rightfully associated with marriage. These stones stimulate shukra, the body’s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this stone. Wear your diamond set in gold, either as a necklace or as a ring on the ring finger. But note: Diamonds of low quality may have negative effects upon the body.

## Red Coral

This gemstone from the sea represents the planet Mars. It calms pitta and helps one to control anger, hatred, and jealousy. Coral gives energy to the liver, spleen, and pericardium. Wear your red coral as a necklace or as a ring set in copper (preferably), silver, or white gold and worn on the ring finger. Red coral is strength-giving and imparts gracefulness.

## Opal

This semiprecious stone represents the planet Neptune. It strengthens majja dhatu (bone marrow and nerves) as well as shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue). It improves vision, relieves fever, calms pitta, and is good for migraine headaches. Opals enhance spiritual feelings, increase devotion, and help to unfold intuition. This gem is particularly beneficial for individuals with Neptune in their third, fourth, sixth, tenth, or twelfth astrological house. It should be set in gold or silver and worn on the ring finger.

## Cat’s-Eye

This stone is good for allergies, repeated colds and congestion, and allergic asthma. It pacifies kapha and vata while slightly increasing pitta. It aids in healing kidney dysfunction. Cat’s-eye enhances awareness and helps a person not get caught up in emotions. People working in psychological healing should wear this stone in a gold setting on their ring or little finger; it will help protect them from negative influences.

## Quartz Crystals

These stones have a Venus-like vibratory energy that is somewhat like that of diamonds. They calm vata, improve the quality of perception, strengthen communication, and enhance intuition. You can wear quartz crystals as a necklace, or set in either silver or gold and worn on the ring finger.

## Onyx

This stone is excellent for vata disorders. It is good for old age, debilitating disorders, and neurological dysfunction, and it helps with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and even schizophrenia. It induces quiet, deep sleep yet combats lethargy. It is good for memory and promotes positive thinking. Onyx makes life peaceful and happy and enhances love in relationships. It has energy vibrations that are Sun-like and Jupiter-like. This stone should be set in silver and worn on the ring finger. (If your Sun sign is in Sagittarius or Gemini, it is better not to wear this stone.)

## Jade

Jade is beneficial for longevity. It strengthens kidney energy and is reputed to bestow success upon its wearer. This stone is also good for the power of speech. It helps to prevent cataracts and is strengthening for the prostate. Wear a jade ring set in silver, on your little finger.

## Amethyst

Amethyst is a stone for the crown chakra and is good for mental clarity. To bring prosperity, it should be set in gold. You can also wear it around the neck on a gold necklace. A person with neuromuscular weakness can be helped by wearing amethysts and by putting them at the four corners of the bed. Some amethysts have a darker color, which gives them a Saturn-like energy similar to blue sapphire. Amethysts bestow dignity, love, compassion, and hope. This gem helps the individual to control emotions and is good for vata and pitta imbalance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. Each illness is approached holistically, taking into account the individual's dosha constitution and overall health.

### Red

Red is a warming and stimulating color. It can relieve aggravated Vata and reduce excess Kapha. However, overexposure to red may aggravate Pitta and lead to inflammatory ailments. Red stimulates the formation of red blood cells, improves circulation, and gives energy to nerve tissue and bone marrow.

### Orange

Orange is a warming color with healing energy. It is sexually stimulating and provides energy to the sex organs. Orange is balancing to Vata and Kapha but may aggravate Pitta. It has antibacterial properties and hinders the growth of bacteria.

### Yellow

Yellow relieves excess Vata and Kapha. It promotes understanding, intelligence, and spiritual realization. Yellow acts as a decongestant and antibacterial. Overexposure to yellow may increase Pitta dosha.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

This appendix briefly explains the preparation of herbs and special remedies such as medicated oils and ghees and offers suggestions on their use. For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1
- 3 teaspoons of herb 2
- ¼ teaspoon of herb 3

If you are making a large batch for long-term use, you can measure in tablespoons. A 1- to 2-month supply will require 2.5 to 5.0 ounces of herbs, a palm-size quantity. Again,

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee. Lubricate the syringe tip with oil or ghee, insert it into the rectum, and release the clip to allow the fluid to enter. Hold the fluid for 10 minutes, then assume a hands-and-knees position to relax the colon. Massage the colon area lightly in a counterclockwise motion. Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

## Nasya

Nasya is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or fine powders. When self-administering nasya, dip your clean finger into the recommended oil or ghee, and gently massage the inside of your nostril before sniffing to draw the oil upward.

Nauli is a simple method of massaging the internal organs, especially the colon.

# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.
---
# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are prone to heat-related issues and can become easily aggravated during hot and humid weather. They may experience irritability, anger, and sharpness in their thoughts. To balance Pitta dosha, it is important to avoid excessive heat, oil, and spicy foods.

### General Guidelines for Balancing Pitta

- Avoid excessive heat
- Avoid excessive oil
- Avoid excessive steam
- Limit salt intake
- Eat cooling, non-spicy foods
- Drink cool (but not iced) drinks
- Exercise during the cooler part of the day

## Characteristics of Kapha Dosha

Kapha individuals have strong, well-developed bodies with a tendency to gain weight due to slow metabolism. They have large frames, oily skin, and thick hair. Kapha types generally have a steady appetite and thirst, with slow digestion.

Kaphas who maintain health and balance can enjoy a long lifespan. However, aggravation of Kapha dosha can lead to health issues and weight gain.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

### LIKE INCREASES LIKE

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

## Seasons

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent disease.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

One of the key treatments in Ayurveda is Panchakarma, a five-procedure program aimed at detoxifying the body. The program includes preparatory methods like internal oleation with ghee, external oleation with oil massage and sweating, and specific actions to eliminate excess doshas and toxins.

Some of the procedures involved in Panchakarma include therapeutic vomiting (vamana), purgation or laxative therapy (virechana), medicated enema therapy (basti), nasal administration of medication (nasya), and purification of the blood (rakta moksha).

Ayurveda also offers other methods to remove toxins from the body based on the individual's strength and the severity of the disease.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls metabolism and digestion. An excess of Pitta can result in inflammation, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Influenced by the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs stability and structure. Imbalance in Kapha may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Panchakarma: A powerful cleansing procedure in Ayurveda that is tailored to each individual's constitution and medical condition. It requires close supervision and post-treatment support.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, constipation, and insomnia.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and indigestion.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may cause congestion, lethargy, and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Home remedies in Ayurveda aim not only to treat the symptoms but also to purify the body and prevent future diseases. Rejuvenation and rebuilding are essential aspects of Ayurvedic healing.

### Schedule for Home Panchakarma

Here is an ideal schedule for your home panchakarma purification treatment:

|Day|Internal|External|Oil Bath|Basti|Your Doshic Diet|Diet|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Monday|Monodiet Kitchari|Kitchari with steamed vegetables|Coriander/cumin/fennel tea| | | |

### Rejuvenation and Rebuilding

The purpose of panchakarma is not just to get well but to purify and strengthen the body for long-term health. Rejuvenatives like rasayanas promote renewal and longevity at the cellular level.

#### Rejuvenative Herbs

- Vata: Ashwagandha in hot milk twice a day.
- Pitta: Shatavari in warm milk twice a day.
- Kapha: Punarnava in warm water twice a day.

Herbal mixtures like chyavanprash can also be used to tonify the system and enhance overall health.

### Three Cautions About Home Panchakarma

1. Panchakarma, even in a gentle home program, has a powerful effect.

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism. It is associated with intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is associated with strength and endurance.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for common health issues:

### Eye Care

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

For more detailed information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Dry, light, cold, and rough. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

Consult a qualified ayurvedic practitioner before trying any remedies mentioned in this book.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and erratic. Pitta is characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, intense, and oily. Kapha is characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## Guidelines for Vata Imbalance

- Keep warm and dress warmly, especially on windy days.
- Avoid very active exercise, especially if you have a vata constitution.
- A short afternoon nap is acceptable for vatas.
- Try to be in bed by 10 P.M.
- Drink a cup of warm milk at bedtime with warming herbs like ginger and cardamom.
- Consider panchakarma treatment to remove excess vata from the system.
- Avoid loud noise, loud music, fast driving, and too much sexual activity.
- Herbs like dashamoola, ashwagandha, bala, and vidari are excellent for pacifying vata dosha.

## Guidelines for Winter

Winter is generally a season of kapha, but vata-provoking qualities can also be prominent. Here are some tips:

- Adopt a kapha-pacifying regimen, especially for kapha individuals.
- Avoid dry, cold, windy, and clear conditions that can provoke vata.

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is characterized by qualities such as dry, light, cold, rough, and mobile. Imbalance in Vata can lead to issues like anxiety, constipation, and insomnia.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta exhibits qualities like hot, sharp, light, oily, and liquid. Pitta imbalance may manifest as anger, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha is heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalanced Kapha can result in weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

In Ayurveda, seasonal changes can impact our health and well-being. Here are some remedies for the spring season to balance Kapha dosha:

- Include herbs like ginger, black pepper, pippali, cumin, coriander, and fennel in your diet.
- Avoid heavy, oily, sour, sweet, and salty foods that provoke Kapha. Opt for bitter, pungent, and astringent foods instead.
- Limit dairy products, ice cream, and cold drinks as they can aggravate Kapha.
- Engage in kapha-reducing yoga postures and pranayama techniques like Bhastrika and Right Nostril breathing.
- Consider a juice fast with apple, pomegranate, or berry juice to cleanse your system.
- Avoid daytime naps as they can worsen Kapha imbalance.

As the weather transitions from spring to summer, adapt your diet and lifestyle to pacify Pitta dosha. Stay mindful of your body's needs and maintain balance throughout the changing seasons.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.
---
# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Meditation Technique for Inner Peace

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.

# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

## Double-Arrowed Attention (Witnessing)
---
# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

WITNESSING AWARENESS

Object - Me

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

Vata: Characterized by qualities of dry, light, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, liquid, and oily.

Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Sweet Taste

The sweet taste is present in foods such as rice, sugar, milk, wheat, dates, and maple syrup. It increases the vital essence of life and promotes growth of all seven dhatus. Proper use gives strength and longevity.

Benefits: Encourages the senses, improves complexion, promotes healthy skin, hair, and voice, relieves thirst and burning sensations, and promotes stability.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

Effects of Excess: Excessive use can cause thirst, hyperacidity, heartburn, ulcers, skin conditions, and acid pH imbalance in the body.

### Salty Taste

Examples include sea salt, rock salt, and kelp. Salt, when used moderately, relieves vata, increases pitta and kapha, promotes growth, and aids digestion.

Caution: Too much salt may lead to thickening of blood, hypertension, skin issues, water retention, and other health problems.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.

- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, soft, and oily. Governs structure and lubrication in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Pungent Taste

The pungent taste is present in various hot peppers, onions, radishes, garlic, mustard, and ginger. It aids digestion, clears sinuses, and improves circulation. However, overuse can lead to negative reactions like sexual debility and digestive issues.

### Bitter Taste

Found in coffee, bitter melon, aloe vera, and various herbs, the bitter taste is cooling and antitoxic. It can relieve burning sensations, reduce fever, and promote skin and muscle firmness. Excessive consumption may deplete essential elements in the body and lead to debility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body. Imbalance in the doshas can lead to various health issues.

## Effects of Tastes on the Doshas

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

You can alleviate some of the ill effects of these combinations by using spices and herbs in your cooking. A strong digestive fire can be

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

These remedies can help balance emotions and control anger and hostility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

Calming Tea: Make a tea using specific herbs:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Appetite, Low

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.
---
# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Backache

Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola powder in a pint of water for about 5 minutes, cool it down, and add ½ cup sesame oil. When it is cool enough, use it as an enema, retaining the liquid for 5 to 10 minutes if you can. A dashamoola-sesame oil enema is soothing to vata and will help relieve both the constipation and the pain.

Gentle Stretches: Some gentle yoga exercises can help with back pain. It is important to learn yoga postures with a trained yoga teacher, especially when dealing with backache, and avoid any postures without expert guidance, particularly if the pain comes from a slipped disk.

In general, the following postures may be helpful:

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Boil Remedies

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

## Herbal Formula for Healthy Lactation

To maintain healthy lactation, use the following herbal formula:

- kutki 2 parts
- shilajit 2 parts
- shatavari 3 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Mineral Supplements for Brittle Nails

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body.
- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.
---
# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Constipation

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Constipation

## Raisins

A handful of raisins every day, at least an hour after meals.

## Prunes

## Peaches

One or two peaches about an hour after meals.

## Eat More Fiber

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help keep the bowels regular. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are also high in fiber.

## Milk and Ghee

Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at bedtime is an effective and gentle means of relieving constipation, especially for vata and pitta constitutions.

## Castor Oil

Castor oil can be used for obstinate constipation. A remedy is to make ginger tea, add 2 teaspoons of castor oil, and drink it before bedtime. Adjust the dose as needed.

Suggestion: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends when you can stay home.

## Flaxseed

Boil 1 tablespoon of flaxseed in a cup of water at night for at least 2 to 3 minutes. Drink the whole cupful, including the tea and seeds.

## For Constipation in Children

Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.

## For Severe Constipation

If there is absolute constipation for three days, avoid purgatives. Instead, do an enema with warm water or herbal tea like triphala or dashamoola.

## Prevention

Here are several suggestions for avoiding constipation in the future.

## Constipation

Follow the vata-pacifying diet. Use a lot of fiber in your diet and drink 4 to 5 glasses of water a day. Regular exercise, such as walking or yoga, can also help prevent constipation.

For constipation during pregnancy, consider using sat isabgol (psyllium husks) with warm milk or a combination of hot milk and ghee for gentle laxative action. Avoid using triphala or castor oil during pregnancy.

## Cough

Ayurveda suggests that most coughs are caused by excess pitta or kapha in the bronchial tree. To manage a cough effectively, determine if it is dry (vata) or productive with mucus (kapha), or if pitta is involved.

## Dry Cough Remedies

For a dry cough or a cough without much mucus, try the following remedies:

- Eat a ripe banana with 1 teaspoon of honey and 2 pinches of ground black pepper 2-3 times a day.
- Chop a clove of garlic, boil it in a cup of milk, and add ¼ teaspoon turmeric to create garlic-turmeric milk for soothing and healing most types of cough.
- Chew ¼ teaspoon of ajwain mixed with 1 teaspoon of natural organic sugar.
- Make talisadi tea by mixing talisadi powder, licorice powder, and honey for an effective remedy.

## Productive Cough Remedies

For a productive or kapha cough, consider the following home remedies:

- Mix ¼ teaspoon of black pepper powder with 1 teaspoon of honey and consume it on a full stomach to relieve congestion and drive out the cough.
- Prepare a tea with ginger powder, clove, and cinnamon powder in boiled water for cough relief.
- If the cough persists, mix ground mustard and ginger powder with honey and eat slowly 2-3 times a day.

These ayurvedic remedies can help alleviate different types of cough effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

For best results, follow this schedule:

- Week 1: Every day
- Week 2: Every 2 days
- Week 3: Every 3 days
- Week 4: Once

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

## Simple and Best Remedy for Irritated Eyes

Put a single drop of pure, genuine castor oil (without preservatives) into your eyes at bedtime. Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles of your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil from staining your sheets.

## Bloodshot Eyes Remedy

If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange juice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.

### Fainting and Dizziness

Additional information on fainting and dizziness remedies can be found in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

Combine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and...

### Important Note

This liver-flushing treatment should not be done without the approval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an Ayurvedic physician to avoid damaging the gallbladder and experiencing dangerous complications.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

5. Avoid spicy and oily foods that can trigger heartburn and acid reflux.

By incorporating these Ayurvedic home remedies into your routine, you can effectively manage heartburn and acid stomach issues naturally.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

### Time to See the Doctor:

There are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, uremic hiccups, and cerebral hiccups, which require medical attention.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

- Jatamamsi - 2 parts
- Musta - 2 parts
- Tagar - 1 part

Steep ½ teaspoon of the herb mixture in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drink the tea after lunch and dinner.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Keep Cool: Avoid working hard under the hot sun if you have high blood pressure to prevent promoting hemorrhage in the brain.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

## Preventing Adult-Onset Diabetes

Ingredients:

- Shilajit - 1 part
- Shardunika - 1 part

Instructions: Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture after lunch and dinner with some water.

### Yoga Postures

Some yoga asanas to strengthen the pancreas and help prevent hypoglycemia include the Peacock, Camel, and Locust poses, and the Elevated Lotus, as well as nauli (an abdominal exercise explained in appendix 3). Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia should do these yoga exercises and Alternate Nostril breathing.

### Nasya

Brahmi ghee nasya, 5 drops in each nostril, will quickly relieve nausea, sweating, and mental confusion (see appendix 3).

### For Drowsiness

Drowsiness can be corrected by taking some sweet juice, such as pomegranate or sweet orange juice.

## Impotence Remedies

Impotence, which is a man’s inability to have or to maintain an erection, may have several causes. It can be due to emotional, psychological issues, stress, or certain physical problems.

Massage to Improve Circulation: Massage the pubic area and the root of the penis with a few drops of mahanarayan oil to improve circulation and potentially eliminate the problem.

Apply Herbalized Oil: Apply bala oil or ashwagandha oil directly to the penis.

Massage the Prostate Area: Massaging above the prostate gland with the mentioned oils or plain ghee can be beneficial for improving circulation.

## Strengthening Herbal Formula

For internal use, make a mixture of equal proportions of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day in warm milk, continuing for 3 months. Add chopped fresh garlic to the warm milk to improve blood supply and vessel dilation.

## Mild Aphrodisiac Drink

Every night, drink a cup of warm milk with a pinch of saffron added. Saffron is an aphrodisiac and increases sperm count.

## Relax with Tranquillity Tea

If impotence is psychological, try Tranquillity Tea containing jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi in equal proportions. Drink ½ teaspoon of this mixture before bed to alleviate emotional stress.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga poses like Rooster pose, Elevated Lotus, Vajrasana, Chakra Asana, and Bow pose to help with impotence. Refer to illustrations in appendix 4.

## Indigestion

The effectiveness of digestion depends on the strength of your digestive fire (agni). Avoid heavy, liquid, or dense food intake that can inhibit agni. Emotional eating and wrong food combining can also lead to indigestion.

For more information, refer to the chapter on "Urinary Incontinence" in the book.

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Congestion, High Pitta, or Crystal Urea in the Kidney

Congestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all create tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests the following simple remedies:

### Herbal Mixture

Prepare a mixture of the following herbs:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Gokshura - 1 part
- Fennel seed - 1 part

Take 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it down with warm water.

### Cumin-Coriander-Fennel Tea

Prepare a tea by mixing equal amounts of cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds. Boil in water and drink 2 or 3 times a day. (Use about ¼ teaspoon of each herb per cup of water.)

### Ayurvedic Herb Drink

Combine about ½ teaspoon of musta with ½ teaspoon of fennel. Steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.

## Kidney Stones

There are different types of kidney stones corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha dosha:

- Calcium stones (kapha stones)
- Phosphate stones
- Oxalate stones (pitta stones)

### Herbal Remedies

If you already have a kidney stone, Ayurveda suggests Punarnava Guggulu and Gokshuradi Guggulu. Take one tablet of each twice a day after lunch and dinner.

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

## Fruit Fast for Memory Enhancement

A fruit fast can be beneficial for memory improvement as it helps in detoxifying the body and enhancing mental clarity. However, it should be avoided by individuals prone to hypoglycemia. Recommended fruits for the fast based on doshas:

- For Vata: Papayas, prunes, mangoes
- For Pitta: Grapes, pomegranates, apples
- For Kapha: Apples, cranberries, pomegranates

## Other Foods for Memory Improvement

In addition to fruits, certain foods can help in improving memory. Foods like sweet potatoes, tapioca, okra, and spinach are beneficial. Sattvic foods, including fresh fruits, vegetables, almonds, oranges, ghee, and milk, are good for memory enhancement. Avoid heavy meats if you have memory issues.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

- Ginkgo and Gotu Kola: These herbs improve memory by increasing circulation to the brain.
- Medhya Herbs: Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Bhringaraj, and Shanka Pushpi are specific herbs that improve memory. You can make a tea by steeping these herbs in hot water and drink it twice a day for a month.
- Brahmi Milk: Boil Brahmi in milk and drink it at bedtime for remarkable memory improvement. Add saffron for additional benefits.

Consistent use of these herbs and practices can help in enhancing memory and cognitive function over time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and memory problems.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta imbalance may manifest as inflammation and irritability.

Kapha: Comprised of earth and water elements, Kapha provides structure and stability. Imbalance can result in lethargy and congestion.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Memory Problems

Memory problems can be caused by stress and anxiety. Regular meditation, such as the Empty Bowl or So-Hum meditation, can help relieve stress and improve memory.

Avoiding toxic substances like alcohol, marijuana, and certain drugs is crucial for maintaining good memory function. Nicotine toxicity from smoking can also impact memory negatively.

### Menopause Problems

Menopause is a natural phase in a woman's life marked by hormonal changes. Following a vata-pacifying diet and incorporating aloe vera gel and mineral supplements can help alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings.

### Natural Hormone Sources

Consider incorporating natural sources of hormones like aloe vera gel and mineral supplements containing calcium, magnesium, and zinc to support hormonal balance during menopause.

## Menopausal Women

It has become commonplace for modern medicine to prescribe hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women. Ayurveda recommends female rejuvenating herbs like shatavari and wild yam to prevent and alleviate menopausal symptoms. These herbs provide natural food precursors of estrogen and progesterone.

Try a mixture of vidari or wild yam and shatavari twice a day after lunch and dinner during menopause. This can help with symptoms like hot flashes and prevent osteoporosis.

## Hot Flashes

For hot flashes, drink a cup of pomegranate juice with rock candy powder or organic sugar and lime juice 2-3 times a day as needed.

## Vaginal Dryness

To alleviate vaginal dryness, insert a tampon-like shape cotton soaked in sesame oil into the vagina at night. Use a sanitary pad to catch any leakage.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga postures like Sun Salutation, Lotus, Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, Leg Lifts, and Chest-Knee pose to strengthen the lower abdominal area.

## Dysmenorrhea

According to Ayurveda, dysmenorrhea can be divided into three types: vata, pitta, and kapha. Identifying the specific type is crucial for effective treatment.

## Understanding Menstrual Discomfort Based on Doshas

Menstrual discomfort can vary based on one's dosha type. It's important to note that these difficulties can be independent of one's own constitutional type. Here are some characteristics based on doshas:

### Vata

For vata-type dysmenorrhea, symptoms may include more pain before menstruation, bloating, lower abdominal pain, constipation, cramps, and insomnia. Menstrual flow tends to be scanty.

### Pitta

Pitta-type dysmenorrhea involves congestion, inflammation, and irritation. Symptoms may include tender breasts, sensitive bladder, burning sensation while urinating, hot flashes, and irritability. It may lead to profuse menstrual flow.

Kapha-type menstrual problems can be effectively treated by using a mixture of:

- punarnava ½ part
- manjistha ½ part
- trikatu ⅛ part

Take about ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, washed down with warm water.

Application of mustard oil and castor oil (half and half) to the lower abdomen will also help with kapha-type menstrual discomfort.

### Important Note

If self-treatment is not working or appears to be making the condition worse, reassess the situation and try a different line of treatment. Consult a trained Ayurvedic diagnostician if needed.

## For All Body Types

Herbal Remedies: Ayurvedic medicine includes powerful herbal compounds based on the herb guggulu. Choose the following based on your dosha:

- Vata-type pain: triphala guggulu or yogaraj guggulu

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

Perhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to prevent menstrual problems. You can follow this strategy quite easily, effectively, safely, and inexpensively.

ALOE VERA GEL: For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual pain and discomfort.

DIETARY GUIDELINES: Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

YOGA POSITIONS: Throughout the month, spend a few minutes every day on the yoga postures recommended for your body type. Yoga asanas are not recommended during the menstrual period. Just rest, read, and relax as much as possible.

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Migraine Headaches

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

## Preventing and Treating Muscle Cramps

Soak It: For a cramp in your foot, soak the foot in a bucket of warm water that contains salt (1 or 2 tablespoons).

Herbal Relaxants: Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, jatamamsi tea, or comfrey tea. You can also make a tea using equal amounts of all three herbs (⅓ teaspoon of each per cup) to relax your muscles.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

Warm Milk: Warm milk is helpful for abdominal muscle cramps due to its alkaline property and calcium content. Drinking one cup of warm milk at bedtime can help pacify acidity and relax muscles.

## Stomach Muscle Cramps

Lasunadivati (Garlic Compound): Effective for smooth muscle spasm. Take 1 tablet after dinner for 5 days. Garlic relaxes muscles, calms vata dosha, and helps with muscle cramps.

Hingwastak Churna: Take 1/4 teaspoon twice a day after lunch and dinner to relieve abdominal muscle pain. May cause gas.

Triphala: Relieves gases, aids in proper elimination, and helps absorb minerals. Take 1/2 teaspoon at bedtime with warm water to prevent stomach muscle cramps.

## Nasal Crust

When kapha dosha is high, nasal crust may form due to dryness in the atmosphere. Remedies include:

- Steam Inhalation: Inhale steam with ginger, ajwan, and turmeric to ease nasal discharge and breathe freely.
- Menthol and Eucalyptus: Rub menthol on the forehead and sinus area for relief.

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

- Avoid feeding the child’s imagination with disturbing images.
- Engage children in creative play and avoid violent or horrifying TV programs or stories.
- Create a pleasant environment in the child's room with sweet music and tinkling bells.
- Tell positive and uplifting stories to children.
- Give the child a mini-oil massage before bed using brahmi oil or bhringaraj oil.
- Prevent bedwetting by limiting fluid intake before bedtime and consider cumin-coriander-fennel tea.

## Remedies for Adults and Children

Tranquillity Tea:

- Ingredients: jatamamsi, brahmi, ginkgo, yashti madhu (licorice root).
- Instructions: Make a tea from equal proportions of the above ingredients. Drink a cup before bedtime for a peaceful mind and body.
- Alternative: Make a tea of equal amounts of jatamamsi and shanka pushpi.

These remedies are beneficial for both children and adults to promote relaxation and peaceful sleep.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Governs digestion and metabolism.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, soft, and cold. Governs structure and lubrication in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Nosebleeds

To stop nosebleeds, try using pomegranate nose drops by placing a few drops of fresh pomegranate juice in your nostrils. If the bleeding persists, consult a doctor as it could indicate an underlying health issue like high blood pressure or leukemia.

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet by avoiding hot and spicy foods, alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive sun exposure.

### Obesity

Obesity is a condition of excessive body fat accumulation that can lead to various health problems. It is primarily a Kapha disorder caused by overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and lack of exercise.

Factors contributing to obesity include hereditary issues, pregnancy weight gain, stress-induced eating, and certain medications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

Obesity is often caused by eating too much and not getting enough exercise. Factors such as consuming cold drinks, fatty fried foods, dairy products like cheese and ice cream, and excess sugar and carbohydrates can contribute to obesity.

## Watch Your Diet

Control what you eat by following a kapha-pacifying diet. Avoid cold drinks, fatty fried foods, and minimize dairy products. Include salads, beans, and drink hot water or herbal teas like ginger, mint, or cinnamon. Limit meat consumption to fish or chicken once a month.

## Get Adequate Exercise

Engage in regular exercise such as daily walks, aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming, and weight lifting with 5-pound weights. Remember that burning more calories than you consume is essential for weight loss.

## Post-Exercise Prescription

Avoid cold drinks and snacks after exercise. Opt for hot drinks like herbal teas to maintain a healthy metabolism.

## Eat Your Biggest Meal Early in the Day

Skip breakfast if possible, have a substantial meal at noon, and keep supper light. Avoid snacking between meals and consider skipping supper entirely.

## Drop Alcohol and Tobacco

Avoid alcohol and tobacco consumption as these habits can contribute to obesity.

## Listen to Music

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more, so that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and body temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of water and earth. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by thinning and increasing porosity of the bones, often due to increased Vata dosha. It is more common in women, especially after menopause, due to hormonal changes.

Remedies:

- Engage in gentle, daily exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Walking, swimming, or gentle jogging are recommended.
- Include weight-bearing exercises cautiously, especially if diagnosed with osteoporosis, to avoid the risk of fractures.
- Ensure a diet rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other nutrients essential for bone health.

By following these remedies and making lifestyle changes, individuals can manage osteoporosis effectively and improve bone health over time.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

Food nourishes the body; love nourishes the soul. Overeating can be caused by emotional factors such as loneliness, grief, sadness, or depression. In Ayurveda, overeating is linked to prana vata stimulating jatharagni, leading to increased hunger.

## Ways to Deal with Overeating:

1. Express Your Feelings: Write about your feelings to release blocked energy in the solar plexus.
2. Meditate and Breathe: Practice So-Hum meditation or Shitali pranayama to reduce emotional hunger.
3. Yoga: Practice specific yoga exercises like Moon Salutation, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Spinal Twist to control overeating.
4. Walk Off the Cravings: Take a brisk walk for 20 minutes to reduce emotional cravings for food.
5. Eat Lightly: Opt for light foods like crackers, millet, rye, or fruit juice to satisfy hunger without gaining weight.
6. Try Bananas: Eating a ripe banana with ghee and cardamom can help pacify emotional eating habits.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle changes, overeating due to emotional factors can be effectively managed.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Test Your Hunger

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

- Vata type is characterized by low backache, lower abdominal pain, distention, anxiety, fear, insomnia, and mood swings.
- Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, urethritis, hives, hot flashes, irritability, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.
- Kapha-type PMS involves water retention (breasts become enlarged and tender) and drowsiness, so that the woman loves to drink coffee!

PMS can be cared for successfully using the following Ayurvedic remedies and...

## Preventive Measures

IMPORTANT: In all cases, start the preventive program one week before the anticipated start of your period.

### For Vata-Type PMS

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.
---
# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Effective Herbs

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Formula:

Make a formula using the following Ayurvedic herbs:

- Punarnava - 2 parts
- Shilajit - ⅛ part
- Gokshura - 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of the mixture twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water. Continue until symptoms resolve.

## Teas for Relief:

You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea for relief. Follow the directions on the package or use bulk herbs by adding about 1 teaspoon of mixture to a cup of boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, cool, and drink.

## Time to See the Doctor:

If prostate cancer is a possible diagnosis, consult a medical professional. For benign causes, consider the following remedies:

- Cumin-coriander-fennel tea: Mix equal amounts, steep 1 teaspoon in hot water for 5-10 minutes, and drink 2-3 times a day.
- Punarnava guggulu: Take 1 tablet twice a day.
- Mixture of Vidari and Ashwagandha: Take ½ teaspoon 2-3 times a day with warm water.

## Other Helpful Remedies:

Oil Massage: Apply castor oil or sesame oil to the perineum area with gentle circular motions towards the base of the penis.

Yoga Tradition: Perform Ashwini Mudra by pulling the anus inward in tense-release movements. Do 10 repetitions morning and evening. Kukutasana pose can also be beneficial for prostate problems.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.
- Avoid hard physical labor if possible.
- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

... (Additional content truncated for brevity) ...
Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.
- For stomachache with diarrhea, apply fresh ginger juice around the belly button.

---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Stress Relief

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

Find the right match between your job and your personality. Job stress can be a burden when work and personality are not appropriately matched. Discover your true role and goal to reduce stress.

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

## Medicated Nose Drops

Try nasya with brahmi ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee into each nostril for relief. Refer to the nasya instructions for proper usage.

## Stress-Reducing Tea

Prepare a relaxing tea using herbs like chamomile, comfrey, angelica, or brahmi. These teas can help manage stress when consumed 2-3 times a day.

## Yoga Stretching

Practice specific asanas like Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose for stress management. The Lion pose is also effective in relieving stress.

## Meditation

Sit in the Lotus pose or Easy pose, facing east, and meditate. Focus on your breath or try the So-Hum meditation for stress relief.

## Breathe Away Stress

Practice Ujjayi pranayama for calming effects. You can do this breathing exercise sitting up or lying down in Savasana for stress relief.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

# Gems and Stones

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

Symbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in relationships and are rightfully associated with marriage. These stones stimulate shukra, the body’s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this stone. Wear your diamond set in gold, either as a necklace or as a ring on the ring finger. But note: Diamonds of low quality may have negative effects upon the body.

## Red Coral

This gemstone from the sea represents the planet Mars. It calms pitta and helps one to control anger, hatred, and jealousy. Coral gives energy to the liver, spleen, and pericardium. Wear your red coral as a necklace or as a ring set in copper (preferably), silver, or white gold and worn on the ring finger. Red coral is strength-giving and imparts gracefulness.

## Opal

This semiprecious stone represents the planet Neptune. It strengthens majja dhatu (bone marrow and nerves) as well as shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue). It improves vision, relieves fever, calms pitta, and is good for migraine headaches. Opals enhance spiritual feelings, increase devotion, and help to unfold intuition. This gem is particularly beneficial for individuals with Neptune in their third, fourth, sixth, tenth, or twelfth astrological house. It should be set in gold or silver and worn on the ring finger.

It induces quiet, deep sleep yet combats lethargy. It is good for memory and promotes positive thinking. Onyx makes life peaceful and happy and enhances love in relationships. It has energy vibrations that are Sun-like and Jupiter-like. This stone should be set in silver and worn on the ring finger. (If your Sun sign is in Sagittarius or Gemini, it is better not to wear this stone.)

## Jade

Jade is beneficial for longevity. It strengthens kidney energy and is reputed to bestow success upon its wearer. This stone is also good for the power of speech. It helps to prevent cataracts and is strengthening for the prostate. Wear a jade ring set in silver, on your little finger.

## Amethyst

Amethyst is a stone for the crown chakra and is good for mental clarity. To bring prosperity, it should be set in gold. You can also wear it around the neck on a gold necklace. A person with neuromuscular weakness can be helped by wearing amethysts and by putting them at the four corners of the bed. Some amethysts have a darker color, which gives them a Saturn-like energy similar to blue sapphire. Amethysts bestow dignity, love, compassion, and hope. This gem helps the individual to control emotions and is good for vata and pitta imbalance.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and temperature regulation.

Kapha is associated with the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. Each illness is approached holistically, taking into account the individual's dosha constitution and overall health.

### Red

Red is a warming and stimulating color. It can relieve aggravated Vata and reduce excess Kapha. However, overexposure to red may aggravate Pitta and lead to inflammatory ailments. Red stimulates the formation of red blood cells, improves circulation, and gives energy to nerve tissue and bone marrow.

### Orange

Orange is a warming color with healing energy. It is sexually stimulating and provides energy to the sex organs. Orange is balancing to Vata and Kapha but may aggravate Pitta. It has antibacterial properties and hinders the growth of bacteria.

### Yellow

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

This appendix briefly explains the preparation of herbs and special remedies such as medicated oils and ghees and offers suggestions on their use. For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1
- 3 teaspoons of herb 2
- ¼ teaspoon of herb 3

If you are making a large batch for long-term use, you can measure in tablespoons. A 1- to 2-month supply will require 2.5 to 5.0 ounces of herbs, a palm-size quantity. Again,

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee. Lubricate the syringe tip with oil or ghee, insert it into the rectum, and release the clip to allow the fluid to enter.

Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

You cannot really learn how to do yoga asanas properly from written instructions and some illustrations.

If you have already learned how to do yoga asanas, these illustrations will serve to refresh your memory. To learn the postures for the first time, please see a qualified yoga instructor.

# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

The five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth - form the basis of material creation and are present in all matter, including the human body.

### Space (Ether):

Space is universal, formless, and all-pervading. It is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. Psychologically, space provides freedom and peace but can also lead to feelings of emptiness and insecurity.

### Ayurvedic Remedies:

For remedies related to specific illnesses and imbalances, refer to the comprehensive A-Z guide provided in this book.

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with fire and water elements. It governs metabolism and digestion, as well as emotions and intellect.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha combines water and earth elements. It provides structure and stability to the body, as well as lubrication and immunity.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of balancing the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and well-being. Understanding the qualities associated with each dosha is crucial in identifying imbalances and restoring harmony.

## Qualities of Doshas:

- Vata: Associated with dryness, constipation, emaciation, and irregularity.
- Pitta: Linked to heat, burning sensations, inflammation, and irritability.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, lethargy, congestion, and excess mucus.

Ayurvedic treatment involves aligning lifestyle choices with your unique constitution to promote balance and health. Self-awareness, observation, and a willingness to act on your knowledge are key factors in achieving optimal well-being.

The remedies provided in this book are designed to assist you in restoring balance and vitality. By making conscious choices in diet, exercise, and daily routines, you can support your body's natural healing processes and enhance overall health.

Remember, small adjustments in your daily habits can have a significant impact on your well-being. Listen to your body, honor its needs, and cultivate a lifestyle that nurtures harmony and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

One of the main psychological qualities of vata individuals is readiness to change. They are often restless, quick-thinking, and creative. However, they may also experience instability and lack of grounding. Vata types tend to have dry skin, light body frames, and cold hands and feet.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are known for their intense focus, determination, and strong digestion. They can be competitive and ambitious, but may also be prone to anger and irritability when out of balance. Pitta types typically have a medium build, sharp intellect, and warm body temperature.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha types are characterized by their calm and nurturing nature. They are often patient, loving, and compassionate. However, they can also be prone to lethargy and weight gain when imbalanced. Kapha individuals usually have strong, sturdy builds, smooth skin, and a tendency towards sluggish digestion.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include rough skin, cracking joints, anxiety, restlessness, and dry throat. Excess vata can lead to symptoms like bloating, insomnia, and insecurity.
- Pitta: Characteristics include sharp intellect, strong digestion, and tendency towards anger and inflammation. Excess pitta can manifest as heartburn, skin rashes, and irritability.
- Kapha: Characteristics include stability, calmness, and tendency towards lethargy and weight gain. Excess kapha can result in congestion, weight gain, and attachment.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Excess vata is a major factor in PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Symptoms of aggravated vata include bloating, low back ache, anxiety, and insomnia. To balance vata, individuals should stick to a routine, dress warmly, and consume warm, moist foods.

### General Guidelines for Balancing Vata

- Keep warm
- Keep calm
- Avoid raw foods
- Avoid cold foods
- Avoid extreme cold temperatures
- Eat warm foods and spices
- Keep a regular routine

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

# Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

### LIKE INCREASES LIKE

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

## Seasons

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Governs movement, creativity, and communication.
- Pitta: Governs digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governs stability, strength, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Deposition or Infiltration

The aggravated dosha enters weak or defective organs or tissues, leading to pathological changes. Factors like trauma, genetic predisposition, and emotional stress can contribute to this.

### Manifestation

In this stage, signs and symptoms of the disease become apparent, and the person falls sick. Disease manifests in the area of the defective tissue.

### Cellular Deformity Leading to Structural Distortion

At this stage, the disease is fully developed, and structural changes occur. Complications may arise in other organs or tissues.

For more detailed information on cleansing and purification techniques, refer to chapter 4 of the book.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent disease.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues
6. Destruction (Bheda): Manifestation of signs and symptoms

Awareness and prevention play a key role in maintaining health according to Ayurveda. By understanding one's constitution and making mindful choices in diet and lifestyle, one can prevent the abnormal movement of doshas and promote normal functioning.

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

One of the key treatments in Ayurveda is Panchakarma, a five-procedure program aimed at detoxifying the body. The program includes preparatory methods like internal oleation with ghee, external oleation with oil massage and sweating, and specific actions to eliminate excess doshas and toxins.

Some of the procedures involved in Panchakarma include therapeutic vomiting (vamana), purgation or laxative therapy (virechana), medicated enema therapy (basti), nasal administration of medication (nasya), and purification of the blood (rakta moksha).

Ayurveda also offers other methods to remove toxins from the body based on the individual's strength and the severity of the disease.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls metabolism and digestion. An excess of Pitta can result in inflammation, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Influenced by the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs stability and structure. Imbalance in Kapha may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Panchakarma: A powerful cleansing procedure in Ayurveda that is tailored to each individual's constitution and medical condition. It requires close supervision and post-treatment support.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism. It is associated with intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is associated with strength and endurance.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for common health issues:

### Eye Care

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

For more detailed information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

Engage in spiritual reading, drink hot milk with ginger, cardamom, and turmeric to induce sound sleep.

Massage oil on the soles of your feet and scalp for restful sleep. Meditate for a few minutes before sleeping.

## Bedtime Recommendations

Vatas should sleep by 10 PM on the left side, pittas on the right side between 10-11 PM, and kaphas between 11 PM-midnight on the left side.

Kapha individuals should avoid sleeping for long hours to maintain metabolism and weight.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Dry, light, cold, and rough. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

Consult a qualified ayurvedic practitioner before trying any remedies mentioned in this book.

Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha is heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalanced Kapha can result in weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

In Ayurveda, seasonal changes can impact our health and well-being. Here are some remedies for the spring season to balance Kapha dosha:

- Include herbs like ginger, black pepper, pippali, cumin, coriander, and fennel in your diet.
- Avoid heavy, oily, sour, sweet, and salty foods that provoke Kapha. Opt for bitter, pungent, and astringent foods instead.
- Limit dairy products, ice cream, and cold drinks as they can aggravate Kapha.
- Engage in kapha-reducing yoga postures and pranayama techniques like Bhastrika and Right Nostril breathing.
- Consider a juice fast with apple, pomegranate, or berry juice to cleanse your system.
- Avoid daytime naps as they can worsen Kapha imbalance.

As the weather transitions from spring to summer, adapt your diet and lifestyle to pacify Pitta dosha. Stay mindful of your body's needs and maintain balance throughout the changing seasons.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.

# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies Book

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Meditation Technique for Inner Peace

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.
---
# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

## Double-Arrowed Attention (Witnessing)
---
# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

WITNESSING AWARENESS

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

Vata: Characterized by qualities of dry, light, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, liquid, and oily.

Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Sweet Taste

The sweet taste is present in foods such as rice, sugar, milk, wheat, dates, and maple syrup. It increases the vital essence of life and promotes growth of all seven dhatus. Proper use gives strength and longevity.

Benefits: Encourages the senses, improves complexion, promotes healthy skin, hair, and voice, relieves thirst and burning sensations, and promotes stability.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

Effects of Excess: Excessive use can cause thirst, hyperacidity, heartburn, ulcers, skin conditions, and acid pH imbalance in the body.

### Salty Taste

Examples include sea salt, rock salt, and kelp. Salt, when used moderately, relieves vata, increases pitta and kapha, promotes growth, and aids digestion.

Caution: Too much salt may lead to thickening of blood, hypertension, skin issues, water retention, and other health problems.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body. Imbalance in the doshas can lead to various health issues.

## Effects of Tastes on the Doshas

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

You can alleviate some of the ill effects of these combinations by using spices and herbs in your cooking. A strong digestive fire can be

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

These remedies can help balance emotions and control anger and hostility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

Calming Tea: Make a tea using specific herbs:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Doshas

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Appetite, Low

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.

# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

## Immediate Relief for Asthma Attack

Asthma is often triggered by allergies, cold, congestion, cough, or hay fever. To immediately stop wheezing during an asthmatic attack, you can try the following remedy:

- Boil 1 teaspoon of licorice root in a cup of water to make licorice tea.
- Add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil or ½ teaspoon of plain ghee before drinking.
- Take one sip of this tea every 5 to 10 minutes.

In some cases, the licorice tea may induce vomiting, which can be beneficial in eliminating kapha and relieving bronchial spasms.

### Important Note:

Prepare the tea as soon as you feel an attack coming on to prevent serious breathing problems. The tea remains effective for up to 72 hours.

## Herbal Remedies for Long-Term Prevention

For long-term prevention of asthma, you can try the following herbal remedies:

- Mix 1 teaspoon cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon trikatu in boiling water. Add honey before drinking. Take this tea twice a day.
- Prepare a tea with half licorice and half ginger for asthma prevention. Use half a teaspoon of the herbs per cup of water.

These herbal remedies can be beneficial when taken regularly to prevent asthma attacks.

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Boil Remedies

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

## Herbal Formula for Healthy Lactation

To maintain healthy lactation, use the following herbal formula:

- kutki 2 parts
- shilajit 2 parts
- shatavari 3 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Mineral Supplements for Brittle Nails

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body.
- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.

# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

## Raisins

A handful of raisins every day, at least an hour after meals.

## Prunes

## Peaches

One or two peaches about an hour after meals.

## Eat More Fiber

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help keep the bowels regular. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are also high in fiber.

## Milk and Ghee

Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at bedtime is an effective and gentle means of relieving constipation, especially for vata and pitta constitutions.

## Castor Oil

Castor oil can be used for obstinate constipation. A remedy is to make ginger tea, add 2 teaspoons of castor oil, and drink it before bedtime. Adjust the dose as needed.

Suggestion: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends when you can stay home.

## Flaxseed

Boil 1 tablespoon of flaxseed in a cup of water at night for at least 2 to 3 minutes. Drink the whole cupful, including the tea and seeds.

## For Constipation in Children

Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.

## For Severe Constipation

If there is absolute constipation for three days, avoid purgatives. Instead, do an enema with warm water or herbal tea like triphala or dashamoola.

## Prevention

Here are several suggestions for avoiding constipation in the future.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

For best results, follow this schedule:

- Week 1: Every day
- Week 2: Every 2 days
- Week 3: Every 3 days
- Week 4: Once

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

## Simple and Best Remedy for Irritated Eyes

Put a single drop of pure, genuine castor oil (without preservatives) into your eyes at bedtime. Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles of your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil from staining your sheets.

## Bloodshot Eyes Remedy

If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange juice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.

## Pacifying Acidity

### Fainting and Dizziness

Additional information on fainting and dizziness remedies can be found in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

Combine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and...

### Important Note

This liver-flushing treatment should not be done without the approval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an Ayurvedic physician to avoid damaging the gallbladder and experiencing dangerous complications.

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.
---
# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

It is important to note that unhealthy hair may indicate poor absorption of minerals, affecting bone health. The health of hair and nails can reflect bone health.

## Proper Diet

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

## Jatamamsi Remedy for Hangover

Additional Tips:

- Drinking coconut water is beneficial for a hangover.
- Using nasya with bhringaraj oil or brahmi ghee can be effective.
- The herbal compound tikta is an effective antidote for alcohol toxicity.

## Headaches in Ayurveda

Headaches in Ayurveda are classified based on doshas:

- Vata type: Occipital area or left side headaches due to vata imbalance.
- Pitta type: Temple area headaches due to excess pitta and acidic conditions.
- Kapha type: Frontal and nasal area headaches due to kapha imbalance.

Other causes of headaches in Ayurveda include ear problems, eye problems, food allergies, and poor sleeping positions.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

### Time to See the Doctor:

There are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, uremic hiccups, and cerebral hiccups, which require medical attention.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

Lie flat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the flow of your breath and practice quiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes. This natural antidote for hypertension can help you relax.

Meditation: Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure and can be as effective as medications in controlling hypertension without negative side effects.

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Kidney Issues

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Kidney Issues

## Congestion, High Pitta, or Crystal Urea in the Kidney

Congestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all create tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests the following simple remedies:

### Herbal Mixture

Prepare a mixture of the following herbs:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Gokshura - 1 part
- Fennel seed - 1 part

Take 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it down with warm water.

### Cumin-Coriander-Fennel Tea

Prepare a tea by mixing equal amounts of cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds. Boil in water and drink 2 or 3 times a day. (Use about ¼ teaspoon of each herb per cup of water.)

### Ayurvedic Herb Drink

Combine about ½ teaspoon of musta with ½ teaspoon of fennel. Steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.

## Kidney Stones

There are different types of kidney stones corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha dosha:

- Calcium stones (kapha stones)
- Phosphate stones
- Oxalate stones (pitta stones)

### Herbal Remedies

If you already have a kidney stone, Ayurveda suggests Punarnava Guggulu and Gokshuradi Guggulu. Take one tablet of each twice a day after lunch and dinner.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Memory Improvement

## Fruit Fast for Memory Enhancement

A fruit fast can be beneficial for memory improvement as it helps in detoxifying the body and enhancing mental clarity. However, it should be avoided by individuals prone to hypoglycemia. Recommended fruits for the fast based on doshas:

- For Vata: Papayas, prunes, mangoes
- For Pitta: Grapes, pomegranates, apples
- For Kapha: Apples, cranberries, pomegranates

## Other Foods for Memory Improvement

In addition to fruits, certain foods can help in improving memory. Foods like sweet potatoes, tapioca, okra, and spinach are beneficial. Sattvic foods, including fresh fruits, vegetables, almonds, oranges, ghee, and milk, are good for memory enhancement. Avoid heavy meats if you have memory issues.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

- Ginkgo and Gotu Kola: These herbs improve memory by increasing circulation to the brain.
- Medhya Herbs: Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Bhringaraj, and Shanka Pushpi are specific herbs that improve memory. You can make a tea by steeping these herbs in hot water and drink it twice a day for a month.
- Brahmi Milk: Boil Brahmi in milk and drink it at bedtime for remarkable memory improvement. Add saffron for additional benefits.

Consistent use of these herbs and practices can help in enhancing memory and cognitive function over time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and memory problems.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta imbalance may manifest as inflammation and irritability.

Kapha: Comprised of earth and water elements, Kapha provides structure and stability. Imbalance can result in lethargy and congestion.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Memory Problems

Memory problems can be caused by stress and anxiety. Regular meditation, such as the Empty Bowl or So-Hum meditation, can help relieve stress and improve memory.

Avoiding toxic substances like alcohol, marijuana, and certain drugs is crucial for maintaining good memory function. Nicotine toxicity from smoking can also impact memory negatively.

### Menopause Problems

Menopause is a natural phase in a woman's life marked by hormonal changes. Following a vata-pacifying diet and incorporating aloe vera gel and mineral supplements can help alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings.

### Natural Hormone Sources

Consider incorporating natural sources of hormones like aloe vera gel and mineral supplements containing calcium, magnesium, and zinc to support hormonal balance during menopause.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Menopausal Women

It has become commonplace for modern medicine to prescribe hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women. Ayurveda recommends female rejuvenating herbs like shatavari and wild yam to prevent and alleviate menopausal symptoms. These herbs provide natural food precursors of estrogen and progesterone.

Try a mixture of vidari or wild yam and shatavari twice a day after lunch and dinner during menopause. This can help with symptoms like hot flashes and prevent osteoporosis.

## Hot Flashes

For hot flashes, drink a cup of pomegranate juice with rock candy powder or organic sugar and lime juice 2-3 times a day as needed.

## Vaginal Dryness

To alleviate vaginal dryness, insert a tampon-like shape cotton soaked in sesame oil into the vagina at night. Use a sanitary pad to catch any leakage.

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga postures like Sun Salutation, Lotus, Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, Leg Lifts, and Chest-Knee pose to strengthen the lower abdominal area.

## Dysmenorrhea

According to Ayurveda, dysmenorrhea can be divided into three types: vata, pitta, and kapha. Identifying the specific type is crucial for effective treatment.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Menstrual Discomfort

## Understanding Menstrual Discomfort Based on Doshas

Menstrual discomfort can vary based on one's dosha type. It's important to note that these difficulties can be independent of one's own constitutional type. Here are some characteristics based on doshas:

### Vata

For vata-type dysmenorrhea, symptoms may include more pain before menstruation, bloating, lower abdominal pain, constipation, cramps, and insomnia. Menstrual flow tends to be scanty.

### Pitta

Pitta-type dysmenorrhea involves congestion, inflammation, and irritation. Symptoms may include tender breasts, sensitive bladder, burning sensation while urinating, hot flashes, and irritability. It may lead to profuse menstrual flow.

### Kapha

In kapha-type menstrual difficulties, there is congestion and pain typically occurs in the later part of the menstrual period. Symptoms may include white discharge, bloating, water retention, feelings of heaviness, lethargy, and drowsiness.

## Treatments for Dysmenorrhea

Here are some effective treatments for each type of disorder:

### Vata

For vata-type menstrual discomfort:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Menstrual Problems

## KAPHA Dosha

Kapha-type menstrual problems can be effectively treated by using a mixture of:

- punarnava ½ part
- manjistha ½ part
- trikatu ⅛ part

Take about ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, washed down with warm water.

Application of mustard oil and castor oil (half and half) to the lower abdomen will also help with kapha-type menstrual discomfort.

### Important Note

If self-treatment is not working or appears to be making the condition worse, reassess the situation and try a different line of treatment. Consult a trained Ayurvedic diagnostician if needed.

## For All Body Types

Herbal Remedies: Ayurvedic medicine includes powerful herbal compounds based on the herb guggulu. Choose the following based on your dosha:

- Vata-type pain: triphala guggulu or yogaraj guggulu
- Pitta: kaishore guggulu
- Kapha: punarnava guggulu

Take one tablet twice a day. These tablets are generally available from sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Universal Remedy: Roast cumin seeds until pungent, chew about 1 teaspoon slowly, and follow with one tablespoon aloe vera juice.

### For Excessive Menstrual Flow

A tea made of raspberry leaves and hibiscus flowers is often effective. Also, try drinking coconut water with rock candy powder added or eating fresh raspberries on an empty stomach.

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

Perhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to prevent menstrual problems. You can follow this strategy quite easily, effectively, safely, and inexpensively.

ALOE VERA GEL: For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual pain and discomfort.

DIETARY GUIDELINES: Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

YOGA POSITIONS: Throughout the month, spend a few minutes every day on the yoga postures recommended for your body type. Yoga asanas are not recommended during the menstrual period. Just rest, read, and relax as much as possible.

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

## Preventing and Treating Muscle Cramps

Soak It: For a cramp in your foot, soak the foot in a bucket of warm water that contains salt (1 or 2 tablespoons).

Herbal Relaxants: Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, jatamamsi tea, or comfrey tea. You can also make a tea using equal amounts of all three herbs (⅓ teaspoon of each per cup) to relax your muscles.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

Hingwastak Churna: Take 1/4 teaspoon twice a day after lunch and dinner to relieve abdominal muscle pain. May cause gas.

Triphala: Relieves gases, aids in proper elimination, and helps absorb minerals. Take 1/2 teaspoon at bedtime with warm water to prevent stomach muscle cramps.

## Nasal Crust

When kapha dosha is high, nasal crust may form due to dryness in the atmosphere. Remedies include:

- Steam Inhalation: Inhale steam with ginger, ajwan, and turmeric to ease nasal discharge and breathe freely.
- Menthol and Eucalyptus: Rub menthol on the forehead and sinus area for relief.

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

- Avoid feeding the child’s imagination with disturbing images.
- Engage children in creative play and avoid violent or horrifying TV programs or stories.
- Create a pleasant environment in the child's room with sweet music and tinkling bells.
- Tell positive and uplifting stories to children.
- Give the child a mini-oil massage before bed using brahmi oil or bhringaraj oil.
- Prevent bedwetting by limiting fluid intake before bedtime and consider cumin-coriander-fennel tea.

## Remedies for Adults and Children

Tranquillity Tea:

- Ingredients: jatamamsi, brahmi, ginkgo, yashti madhu (licorice root).
- Instructions: Make a tea from equal proportions of the above ingredients. Drink a cup before bedtime for a peaceful mind and body.
- Alternative: Make a tea of equal amounts of jatamamsi and shanka pushpi.

These remedies are beneficial for both children and adults to promote relaxation and peaceful sleep.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Governs digestion and metabolism.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, soft, and cold. Governs structure and lubrication in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Nosebleeds

To stop nosebleeds, try using pomegranate nose drops by placing a few drops of fresh pomegranate juice in your nostrils. If the bleeding persists, consult a doctor as it could indicate an underlying health issue like high blood pressure or leukemia.

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet by avoiding hot and spicy foods, alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive sun exposure.

### Obesity

Obesity is a condition of excessive body fat accumulation that can lead to various health problems. It is primarily a Kapha disorder caused by overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and lack of exercise.

Factors contributing to obesity include hereditary issues, pregnancy weight gain, stress-induced eating, and certain medications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

Obesity is often caused by eating too much and not getting enough exercise. Factors such as consuming cold drinks, fatty fried foods, dairy products like cheese and ice cream, and excess sugar and carbohydrates can contribute to obesity.

## Watch Your Diet

Control what you eat by following a kapha-pacifying diet. Avoid cold drinks, fatty fried foods, and minimize dairy products. Include salads, beans, and drink hot water or herbal teas like ginger, mint, or cinnamon. Limit meat consumption to fish or chicken once a month.

## Get Adequate Exercise

Engage in regular exercise such as daily walks, aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming, and weight lifting with 5-pound weights. Remember that burning more calories than you consume is essential for weight loss.

## Post-Exercise Prescription

Avoid cold drinks and snacks after exercise. Opt for hot drinks like herbal teas to maintain a healthy metabolism.

## Eat Your Biggest Meal Early in the Day

Skip breakfast if possible, have a substantial meal at noon, and keep supper light. Avoid snacking between meals and consider skipping supper entirely.

## Drop Alcohol and Tobacco

Avoid alcohol and tobacco consumption as these habits can contribute to obesity.

## Listen to Music

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more, so that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and body temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of water and earth. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by thinning and increasing porosity of the bones, often due to increased Vata dosha. It is more common in women, especially after menopause, due to hormonal changes.

Remedies:

- Engage in gentle, daily exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Walking, swimming, or gentle jogging are recommended.
- Include weight-bearing exercises cautiously, especially if diagnosed with osteoporosis, to avoid the risk of fractures.
- Ensure a diet rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other nutrients essential for bone health.

By following these remedies and making lifestyle changes, individuals can manage osteoporosis effectively and improve bone health over time.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Overeating

Food nourishes the body; love nourishes the soul. Overeating can be caused by emotional factors such as loneliness, grief, sadness, or depression. In Ayurveda, overeating is linked to prana vata stimulating jatharagni, leading to increased hunger.

1. Express Your Feelings: Write about your feelings to release blocked energy in the solar plexus.
2. Meditate and Breathe: Practice So-Hum meditation or Shitali pranayama to reduce emotional hunger.
3. Yoga: Practice specific yoga exercises like Moon Salutation, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Spinal Twist to control overeating.

5. Eat Lightly: Opt for light foods like crackers, millet, rye, or fruit juice to satisfy hunger without gaining weight.

## Test Your Hunger

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.
---
# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Effective Herbs

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Formula:

Make a formula using the following Ayurvedic herbs:

- Punarnava - 2 parts
- Shilajit - ⅛ part
- Gokshura - 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of the mixture twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water. Continue until symptoms resolve.

## Teas for Relief:

You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea for relief. Follow the directions on the package or use bulk herbs by adding about 1 teaspoon of mixture to a cup of boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, cool, and drink.

## Time to See the Doctor:

If prostate cancer is a possible diagnosis, consult a medical professional. For benign causes, consider the following remedies:

- Cumin-coriander-fennel tea: Mix equal amounts, steep 1 teaspoon in hot water for 5-10 minutes, and drink 2-3 times a day.
- Punarnava guggulu: Take 1 tablet twice a day.
- Mixture of Vidari and Ashwagandha: Take ½ teaspoon 2-3 times a day with warm water.

## Other Helpful Remedies:

Oil Massage: Apply castor oil or sesame oil to the perineum area with gentle circular motions towards the base of the penis.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts
- Cumin 1 part
- Raw natural sugar 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot milk, and drink it once or twice a day until the condition is healed.

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.
- Avoid hard physical labor if possible.
- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

... (Additional content truncated for brevity) ...
Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.

---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Stress Relief

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

Find the right match between your job and your personality. Job stress can be a burden when work and personality are not appropriately matched. Discover your true role and goal to reduce stress.

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

## Medicated Nose Drops

Try nasya with brahmi ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee into each nostril for relief. Refer to the nasya instructions for proper usage.

## Stress-Reducing Tea

Prepare a relaxing tea using herbs like chamomile, comfrey, angelica, or brahmi. These teas can help manage stress when consumed 2-3 times a day.

## Yoga Stretching

Practice specific asanas like Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose for stress management. The Lion pose is also effective in relieving stress.

## Meditation

Sit in the Lotus pose or Easy pose, facing east, and meditate. Focus on your breath or try the So-Hum meditation for stress relief.

## Breathe Away Stress

Practice Ujjayi pranayama for calming effects. You can do this breathing exercise sitting up or lying down in Savasana for stress relief.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

## Gentle Stretching

Careful, gentle stretching of the affected muscles will gradually help to improve circulation and heal the pain and inflammation.

## Take Anti-Inflammatory Herbs

Taking some anti-inflammatory herbs will accelerate healing. Make this formula:

- kaishore guggulu 2 parts
- manjistha 2 parts

Oil Massage: Gently massage the affected area with mahanarayan oil and soak it in warm water.

## Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ears)

Herbal Remedies: According to Ayurveda, ringing in the ear is a vata disorder. To alleviate this root cause, prepare a tea made from equal amounts of comfrey, cinnamon, and chamomile. Drink 2 or 3 times a day.

- Take yogaraj guggulu (200 mg. 2 or 3 times a day) with warm water after food.
- Gently rub the mastoid bone with warm sesame oil twice a day for a week.
- Place 3 drops of garlic oil into your ear at night before bed.

Refer to the appendix for more information on preparing oils like garlic oil.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

## Douche for Vaginal Yeast Infection

If the yeast infection is vaginal, you will find it helpful to douche with licorice tea. Follow these steps:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of licorice powder in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.

NOTE: If you have a thick discharge from the genitals, along with an itching and burning sensation, it will be better to do the douche with triphala tea instead of licorice. Use the same procedure: take 1 tablespoon of triphala, boil it in a pint of water, cool, strain, and use the tea as a douche.

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

# Gems and Stones

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

The doshic effects of diamonds vary according to their color. Red diamonds have a fiery energy that stimulates pitta; blue diamonds are cooling and calm pitta while increasing kapha. Clear, colorless diamonds calm pitta but increase both vata and kapha.

Symbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in relationships and are rightfully associated with marriage. These stones stimulate shukra, the body’s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this stone. Wear your diamond set in gold, either as a necklace or as a ring on the ring finger. But note: Diamonds of low quality may have negative effects upon the body.

## Red Coral

This gemstone from the sea represents the planet Mars. It calms pitta and helps one to control anger, hatred, and jealousy. Coral gives energy to the liver, spleen, and pericardium. Wear your red coral as a necklace or as a ring set in copper (preferably), silver, or white gold and worn on the ring finger. Red coral is strength-giving and imparts gracefulness.

## Opal

This semiprecious stone represents the planet Neptune. It strengthens majja dhatu (bone marrow and nerves) as well as shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue). It improves vision, relieves fever, calms pitta, and is good for migraine headaches. Opals enhance spiritual feelings, increase devotion, and help to unfold intuition. This gem is particularly beneficial for individuals with Neptune in their third, fourth, sixth, tenth, or twelfth astrological house. It should be set in gold or silver and worn on the ring finger.

## Cat’s-Eye

This stone is good for allergies, repeated colds and congestion, and allergic asthma. It pacifies kapha and vata while slightly increasing pitta. It aids in healing kidney dysfunction. Cat’s-eye enhances awareness and helps a person not get caught up in emotions. People working in psychological healing should wear this stone in a gold setting on their ring or little finger; it will help protect them from negative influences.

## Onyx

This stone is excellent for vata disorders. It is good for old age, debilitating disorders, and neurological dysfunction, and it helps with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and even schizophrenia. It induces quiet, deep sleep yet combats lethargy. It is good for memory and promotes positive thinking. Onyx makes life peaceful and happy and enhances love in relationships. It has energy vibrations that are Sun-like and Jupiter-like. This stone should be set in silver and worn on the ring finger. (If your Sun sign is in Sagittarius or Gemini, it is better not to wear this stone.)

## Jade

Jade is beneficial for longevity. It strengthens kidney energy and is reputed to bestow success upon its wearer. This stone is also good for the power of speech. It helps to prevent cataracts and is strengthening for the prostate. Wear a jade ring set in silver, on your little finger.

## Amethyst

Amethyst is a stone for the crown chakra and is good for mental clarity. To bring prosperity, it should be set in gold. You can also wear it around the neck on a gold necklace. A person with neuromuscular weakness can be helped by wearing amethysts and by putting them at the four corners of the bed. Some amethysts have a darker color, which gives them a Saturn-like energy similar to blue sapphire. Amethysts bestow dignity, love, compassion, and hope. This gem helps the individual to control emotions and is good for vata and pitta imbalance.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1
- 3 teaspoons of herb 2
- ¼ teaspoon of herb 3

If you are making a large batch for long-term use, you can measure in tablespoons. A 1- to 2-month supply will require 2.5 to 5.0 ounces of herbs, a palm-size quantity. Again,

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee. Lubricate the syringe tip with oil or ghee, insert it into the rectum, and release the clip to allow the fluid to enter. Hold the fluid for 10 minutes, then assume a hands-and-knees position to relax the colon. Massage the colon area lightly in a counterclockwise motion. Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

## Nasya

Nasya is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or fine powders. When self-administering nasya, dip your clean finger into the recommended oil or ghee, and gently massage the inside of your nostril before sniffing to draw the oil upward.

# Introduction

The Need for Healing

Ayurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an ancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives of this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of an unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are carried out by entirely natural means.

According to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three fundamental energies, or doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and an equally vital balance among body, mind, and the soul or consciousness.

Ayurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and relates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of healing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction and relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health, Ayurveda takes into consideration these different levels of life and their interconnectedness.

As a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous adjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The purpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the lifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to create, maintain, or restore health and balance.

Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According to this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique phenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution, which is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this individual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.

These five elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or doshas. Ether and air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; fire and water constitute pitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy; and water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the male sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha factors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment, due to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship, form a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic code; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our prakruti or individual constitution, a constant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of energy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions.

Though the underlying structure of our prakruti remains a fixed reality, our home base or essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in age and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our endlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the food we eat continuously affect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insufficient rest or exercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our dosha balance. Depending on the type of changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:

- Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to conditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as attachment, greed, and possessiveness.
- A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may develop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery, hives, rash, or acne.
- Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica, arthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity.

All these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to human suffering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the individual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease. This is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every individual in every walk of life.

As the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain healthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this adjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with which our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.

To maintain health and balance, we have to juggle with the three doshas, taking action to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires moment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment healing.

Thus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present moment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather asks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our diet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a whole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda teaches that the purpose of life is to know the Creator and understand our relationship with the Cosmic Consciousness. This is achieved through balancing four fundamental aspects: dharma (duty), artha (material success), kama (positive desire), and moksha (spiritual liberation).

## The Importance of Health

Health is the foundation of all aspects of life. Good health is essential for carrying out duties, achieving success, nurturing positive desires, and attaining spiritual liberation. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and daily routine play a significant role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

## Clinical Experience

Through years of medical practice, it has been observed that illness can be a catalyst for self-transformation. Simple remedies like proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, and exercise can restore balance and promote healing. Ayurvedic remedies are rooted in centuries-old principles and have stood the test of time.

## History of Ayurveda

Ayurveda dates back over five thousand years and has been practiced continuously. Scholars like Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata contributed to the development of Ayurvedic knowledge around 900 B.C. It is a science of life that embodies wisdom and practical knowledge accumulated over millennia.

Ayurveda is considered the mother of all healing systems, with its roots in ancient Indian texts and practices. It encompasses various branches such as pediatrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, surgery, and more. These branches have influenced modern medicine and healing modalities like massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture.

## The Wisdom of Charaka

Charaka, a renowned sage-physician and one of the founders of Ayurvedic medicine, emphasized the importance of approaching patients with love and light. He believed that true healing comes from a place of compassion and understanding.

### A Message of Love

This book is a labor of love, crafted with the intention of sharing valuable knowledge for self-healing and well-being. May the remedies and suggestions offered here serve as a guide on your journey to health and healing.

# Chapter 1: Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth. Philosophy is the love of truth. Science is the discovery of truth through experiment. Religion is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living. Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life, body, mind, and spirit. It includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. Purusha, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, pure awareness. Prakruti, the female energy, is active, choiceful consciousness. Both Purusha and Prakruti are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects. Purusha is formless and beyond attributes. Prakruti, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. In the manifestation of nature from Prakruti, the first expression is Mahad (or Mahat), intelligence or cosmic order. Next is Ahamkar or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. Ahamkar expresses itself in three universal qualities: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the principles of balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern the physical and mental characteristics of individuals.

## The Three Doshas:

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with the elements of space and air.
- Pitta: Governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water.
- Kapha: Governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water.

## Characteristics of Doshas:

Vata: Light, dry, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, light, and oily.

Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## The Five Elements:

The five elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth - form the basis of material creation and are present in all matter, including the human body.

### Space (Ether):

Space is universal, formless, and all-pervading. It is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. Psychologically, space provides freedom and peace but can also lead to feelings of emptiness and insecurity.

### Ayurvedic Remedies:

For remedies related to specific illnesses and imbalances, refer to the comprehensive A-Z guide provided in this book.

# Ayurveda and the Five Elements

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, is based on the concept of the five elements - Ether (Space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These elements are believed to exist in all living beings and influence their physical and mental characteristics.

## Fire Element

Fire is hot, dry, sharp, penetrating, and luminous. It is associated with metabolism, digestion, and body temperature regulation. Fire is also linked to intelligence, transformation, and emotions like anger and competitiveness.

## Water Element

Water is fluid, heavy, soft, and cohesive. It is essential for nutrition, hydration, and maintaining life. Water is connected to the sense of taste and emotions such as contentment, love, and compassion.

## Earth Element

Earth is solid, stable, and dense. It provides strength, structure, and stamina to the body. Earth is associated with the sense of smell and influences qualities like forgiveness, support, and groundedness.

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique combination of these elements, known as doshas, which determine their physical and mental constitution.

### Understanding the Doshas

The three doshas - Vata (Ether and Air), Pitta (Fire and Water), and Kapha (Water and Earth) - govern various bodily functions and can become imbalanced, leading to illness.

### A-Z Illness and Remedies

The book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies, focusing on restoring the balance of the doshas through diet, lifestyle changes, herbs, and therapies.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

In Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, every cell in our body has the intelligence to choose its own food based on the elements present in its environment. This intelligence is at work both externally and internally, where the balance of elements constantly shifts with factors like seasons, weather, and time of day.

To maintain health and survival, we must adapt to these changes through our diet, clothing, living environment, and more. It's a continuous balancing act of elements like earth, air, fire, and water. The three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – play a crucial role in this balance.

## The Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha

The three doshas are derived from the five great elements: Vata (space and air), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (water and earth). These doshas govern our psychobiological functioning and are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they promote health, but imbalances can lead to disease.

Vata is associated with movement, Pitta with digestion and metabolism, and Kapha with lubrication and structure. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, known as their constitution or prakruti. Maintaining the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Emotions and qualities are also influenced by the doshas. When in balance, they promote positive emotions like understanding and compassion. However, imbalances due to stress, diet, or environmental factors can lead to negative emotions such as anger and fear.

Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, each person also has an energy print – a specific proportion of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha that defines their constitution. Health is maintained by keeping this proportion in balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The body's internal environment is in constant interplay between order and disorder, determining our health. Health is order, disease is disorder. When the internal and external environments are out of harmony, disorder occurs. Recognizing disorder and restoring order is essential for well-being.

## Understanding Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas combine to create seven constitutional types. Knowing your body type helps in making lifestyle choices for self-healing and well-being.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is the energy of movement, not just the air principle but the subtle energy governing biological movement. It is closely related to prana, the life-force essential for communication and maintaining life functions. Vata regulates all activities in the body, mental and physiological. In balance, it promotes creativity and flexibility, while imbalance leads to fear, anxiety, and nervousness.

#### Characteristics of Vata:

- Dry
- Light
- Cold
- Subtle
- Clear
- Mobile
- Dispersing

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta, the principle of fire, governs metabolism and biochemical changes in the body. It regulates digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body temperature. Pitta controls body temperature through food transformation and comprises enzymes and amino acids essential for metabolism.

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three primary doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific elements and governs various bodily functions.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is characterized by the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with fire and water elements. It governs metabolism and digestion, as well as emotions and intellect.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha combines water and earth elements. It provides structure and stability to the body, as well as lubrication and immunity.

## Imbalance and Remedies

When a dosha is out of balance, it can lead to various physical and emotional ailments. Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal treatments.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This comprehensive guide provides information on a wide range of illnesses and their corresponding ayurvedic remedies. From common colds to chronic conditions, Ayurveda offers natural solutions for healing.

## Conclusion

By understanding the doshas and their characteristics, as well as incorporating ayurvedic practices into daily life, individuals can achieve optimal health and well-being.

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

# Ayurvedic Theory - Qualities and Doshas

Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you to make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental qualities, which appear in ten pairs:

## The Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities

- Heavy—Light
- Oily—Dry
- Stable—Mobile
- Slimy—Rough
- Gross—Subtle
- Cold—Hot
- Slow—Sharp
- Soft—Hard
- Dense—Liquid
- Cloudy—Clear

These qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s weather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable, hot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice cream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry, rough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking may be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or cloudy.

We are constantly affected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry weather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments such as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and may lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne, eczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha, leading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and weight gain.

Each of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two qualities in each pair influence or affect one another according to two fundamental principles of Ayurveda:

1. Like increases like.
2. Opposites decrease each other.

These principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has manifested, successful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities. For example, if there is too much heat (excess pitta), a cool drink, a swim, or some herbs with cooling properties can help restore balance.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of balancing the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and well-being. Understanding the qualities associated with each dosha is crucial in identifying imbalances and restoring harmony.

## Qualities of Doshas:

- Vata: Associated with dryness, constipation, emaciation, and irregularity.
- Pitta: Linked to heat, burning sensations, inflammation, and irritability.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, lethargy, congestion, and excess mucus.

Ayurvedic treatment involves aligning lifestyle choices with your unique constitution to promote balance and health. Self-awareness, observation, and a willingness to act on your knowledge are key factors in achieving optimal well-being.

The remedies provided in this book are designed to assist you in restoring balance and vitality. By making conscious choices in diet, exercise, and daily routines, you can support your body's natural healing processes and enhance overall health.

Remember, small adjustments in your daily habits can have a significant impact on your well-being. Listen to your body, honor its needs, and cultivate a lifestyle that nurtures harmony and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Chapter 2: Discover Your Mental and Physiological Type

This chapter will take you further on your journey toward radiant health as we begin to apply the principles from chapter 1 to discover and understand your own unique constitution.

According to Ayurveda, there are seven main body types:

- Vata
- Pitta
- Kapha
- Vata-Pitta
- Pitta-Kapha
- Kapha-Vata
- Vata-Pitta-Kapha

All three doshas are present in each individual at all times, but their proportion varies from person to person. Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals, will have ten different temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics. Maintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our challenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is good, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.

## Prakruti and Vikruti

At the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta, and kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions of the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents combine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.

If, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant, and the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot summer night after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a constitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a kaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a predominance of kapha dosha.

A few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are equally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long life span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding the Doshas

In Ayurveda, each individual has a unique constitution known as prakruti, which is determined by the predominant dosha or a combination of doshas. The current state of imbalance in the doshas is called vikruti.

Most people will have one dosha predominant, while some may have two doshas in equal proportion, and very few will have all three doshas equally balanced.

## Characteristics of Vata Individuals

Vata individuals typically have light, flexible bodies with small frames, light muscles, and little fat. They may appear slim or underweight, with prominent veins and muscles. Their skin tends to be dry and rough, and they have poor circulation leading to cold hands and feet.

Vatas have a variable appetite and digestion, often preferring astringent foods but needing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. They are prone to digestive difficulties, constipation, and nutrient absorption issues.

Physically, vata types have small, recessed eyes, thin and curly hair, rough skin, cracking joints, and irregular teeth. They are quick walkers, always in a rush, and prefer constant activity and travel.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of mind, body, and spirit to prevent and treat illnesses.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics that influence an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

### Vata Dosha

One of the main psychological qualities of vata individuals is readiness to change. They are often restless, quick-thinking, and creative. However, they may also experience instability and lack of grounding. Vata types tend to have dry skin, light body frames, and cold hands and feet.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta individuals are known for their intense focus, determination, and strong digestion. They can be competitive and ambitious, but may also be prone to anger and irritability when out of balance. Pitta types typically have a medium build, sharp intellect, and warm body temperature.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha types are characterized by their calm and nurturing nature. They are often patient, loving, and compassionate. However, they can also be prone to lethargy and weight gain when imbalanced. Kapha individuals usually have strong, sturdy builds, smooth skin, and a tendency towards sluggish digestion.

- Kapha: Characteristics include stability, calmness, and tendency towards lethargy and weight gain. Excess kapha can result in congestion, weight gain, and attachment.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Excess vata is a major factor in PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Symptoms of aggravated vata include bloating, low back ache, anxiety, and insomnia. To balance vata, individuals should stick to a routine, dress warmly, and consume warm, moist foods.

### General Guidelines for Balancing Vata

- Keep warm
- Keep calm
- Avoid raw foods
- Avoid cold foods
- Avoid extreme cold temperatures
- Eat warm foods and spices
- Keep a regular routine

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

# Characteristics of the Pitta Individual

The pitta body type is one of medium height and build, though some individuals are slender with a delicate frame. They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle development is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.

Pitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of medium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may have reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair loss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!

Moles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less wrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have bleeding gums.

The normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher, and their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite warm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it’s 50 degrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their body perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may have a strong smell.

This heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word pitta is derived from the Sanskrit word tapa, which means to heat. (The word can also be translated as “austerity,” and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low tolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a fiery type, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.

Pittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They consume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of urine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave hot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise he or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.

Pitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These individuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their chest.

Girls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can start menstruation as early as the age of ten.

Pitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the fire principle. They are prone to fevers, inflammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice, profuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes, colitis, and sore throats. All “itises” are inflammatory disorders and are due to excess pitta. These individuals are susceptible to sunburn and do not like bright light.

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

# Pitta Dosha Characteristics

Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, hot flashes, hives, urethritis, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.

Pitta individuals are alert and intelligent and have good powers of comprehension and concentration. Their intellects are penetrating and keen, and their memories are sharp. They have good, logical, investigating minds. They love to go deeply into problems and find solutions. Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve problems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of knowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.

Pittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at night.

Orderliness is important to them. A pitta person’s home or room is always clean and neat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are arranged according to height or another definite system.

Pittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges—very bright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a leadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive by nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political figures. They have a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.

Pittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling, dominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and aggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done on time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which sometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is aggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge themselves.

A pitta’s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy through too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant search for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don’t like the words no or fail and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.

Pittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well off, though they spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive fancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy exhibiting their wealth and possessions.

A number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply eating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and jalapeño peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking sour wine can also be harmful. Working near fire or lying in the sun are causes of increased pitta.

# How to Use This Knowledge

Knowing your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) has many benefits for your life and health:

- Self-understanding, which is the foundation of life, is greatly increased. Ayurveda says that every person is a unique and divine book. To read that book is a great art. The knowledge of prakruti can help you to read your own book, which is your life. By understanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological tendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong and weak areas.
- You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule (vata), irascibility (pitta), or laziness (kapha), or physical problems such as overweight (kapha), ulcers (pitta), or constipation (vata), are directly related to your constitution. The tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is designed.
- When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to have, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your lifestyle—daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on—to keep your doshas in balance and your health at its best.
- You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with whom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in relationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know the constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one another brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a relationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.

Using this knowledge of prakruti, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to him or her, “Honey, it’s not you, it’s your pitta!” That will open a new dimension of understanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.

Use the knowledge of your prakruti as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then look at your vikruti, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using the food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented throughout this book.

For instance, if your vikruti shows more pitta than your prakruti, you will want to follow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess vata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus congestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.

If your prakruti and vikruti seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle guidelines for your strongest dosha.

Finally, remember that “balance” does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and...

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on maintaining a balance between the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique constitution with varying proportions of these doshas.

## Kapha Dosha

Kapha dosha is one of the three doshas in Ayurveda. It is associated with qualities like heaviness, stability, and lubrication. Maintaining the balance of Kapha dosha is essential for overall health and well-being.

Balance in Ayurveda does not mean equal amounts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha; rather, it means maintaining your proportion of the three doshas according to your constitution. It is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium that needs constant renewal.

# Chapter 3: Why We Get Sick

What is health? What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck or of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can we do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?

These are questions that the five-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine has considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of practical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.

Let’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look at ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware of the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set the disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally, we will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest, invisible stages until it is fully grown.

## The Definition of Health

According to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness.

Health consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven tissues (dhatus), the three wastes (malas), and the gastric fire (agni), together with the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.

Although you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to effectively use the remedies in Part III, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger picture of the depth and practicality of this science.

You are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles that govern all activity in the body: vata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta, the energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and structure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.

The dhatus are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of the body and the functioning of the different organs and systems. Crucial to the development and nourishment of the body, the dhatus unfold successively as follows, starting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:

1. Rasa (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently...

# Ayurveda: The Science of Life

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

## The Three Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that govern the body's functions and determine individual constitution.

### Vata Dosha

Vata governs movement and is associated with the elements of air and ether. It controls bodily functions related to motion, including breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta governs metabolism and is associated with the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, absorption, and transformation of food, as well as body temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha governs structure and is associated with the elements of earth and water. It provides stability, lubrication, and support to the body's tissues and organs.

## The Seven Dhatus

The seven dhatus are the fundamental tissues of the body that nourish and support its various functions:

1. Rasa (plasma)
2. Rakta (blood)
3. Mamsa (muscle)
4. Meda (fat)
5. Asthi (bone and cartilage)
6. Majja (bone marrow and nerves)
7. Shukra and Artava (reproductive tissues)

## Importance of Agni

Agni, the biological fire or heat energy, governs metabolism and plays a crucial role in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients. It also maintains the body's immunity and vitality.

## Maintaining Good Health

Good health in Ayurveda is achieved when all seven dhatus develop and function properly, waste products are eliminated efficiently, and agni remains balanced. A harmonious balance of the doshas, dhatus, and agni leads to a state of total well-being known as swastha.

## Conclusion

Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit in maintaining health and preventing disease. By understanding and balancing the doshas, nourishing the dhatus, and supporting agni, one can achieve optimal health and longevity.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Agni

The span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength, enthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily fire). One lives a long healthy life if it is functioning properly, becomes sick if it is deranged, or dies if this fire is extinguished. Proper nourishment of the body, dhatus, ojas, etc., depends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.

The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest the respective components of the food. In this way, balanced agni cooks the appropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health. Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of agni transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness of the cell.

## Maintaining Balance

This state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own constitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions, and a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life. On the other hand, wrong diet, inadequate exercise, troubled relationships, negative or repressed emotions, and an erratic schedule are at the root of disease. These causative factors upset the balance of the doshas, weaken agni and the dhatus, and lead to poor health.

## Ten Factors in Health and Illness

Illness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors that influence us and the effects they produce. The cause is the concealed effect, and the effect is the revealed cause. Health is the effect of a healthy lifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the "tree" sprouted from unhealthy habits.

According to the Charaka Samhita, both the patient and the patient's environment need to be examined in order to arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is important to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset of the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common local diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.

### LIKE INCREASES LIKE

## About Ayurveda

The first important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like increases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and influences (such as food, weather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging, jumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate vata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented food, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating dairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.

The antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This is the key to healing.

NOTE: In general, one’s prakruti indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals of pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not inevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks alcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will definitely get a pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy products and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to congestive kapha disorders.

## Food and Diet

We have already touched on the effects of food on the doshas, and chapter 8 will discuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle is simply that eating the right kinds of food for your prakruti maintains vitality and balance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the first step in the genesis of disease.

Eating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and acidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot afford. For a vata individual, dried fruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke vata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a kapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods definitely add to kapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking diet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are definitely creating imbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.

Wrong food combinations, stale food, food with chemical additives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a rush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is thus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these principles and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also one of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.

# Ayurveda and Seasons

Ayurveda classifies the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy, cool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed by the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy kapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives, the increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in their full intensity in the summer.

Each of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of the season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in someone of the same prakruti. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and aggravation.

For example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals with a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold food and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata illnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta individuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need to keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the hot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to avoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.

We will look further at the seasons, their effects, and how we can best live in harmony with their rhythms and changes in chapter 5, where we discuss the ideal Ayurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.

## Exercise and Health

Exercise is another factor that can profoundly influence your health for better or worse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and immunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is vital for effective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins through sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of calories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the mind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.

On the other hand, insufficient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is inappropriate for one’s constitution can lead to ill health.

Lack of exercise eventually brings a loss of flexibility and strength and puts one at greater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Some amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel good. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle aches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.

Yoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of understanding one's constitution (dosha) for maintaining good health. It categorizes individuals into three doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, each with unique characteristics and exercise requirements.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Can handle strenuous exercise but tends to put on weight if inactive.
- Pitta: Can handle moderate exercise and is more competitive and ambitious.
- Vata: Requires gentle exercise, prefers quieter activities like walking and yoga.

## Age and Doshas

According to Ayurveda, different doshas dominate at different stages of life:

### Childhood (Kapha):

Children are more susceptible to kapha-related illnesses like colds and congestion due to their soft and gentle nature.

### Adulthood (Pitta):

Adults exhibit pitta characteristics such as competitiveness and are prone to pitta-related disorders like gastritis and ulcers.

### Old Age (Vata):

Elderly individuals experience vata-related issues like joint problems, degenerative diseases, and forgetfulness.

## Mental and Emotional Factors

Health and disease are influenced by mental and emotional factors. Imbalance in the mind can lead to physical imbalance and illness.

For more detailed information on exercise and daily routines, refer to Part II of the Ayurvedic home remedies book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurveda and Mind-Body Connection

Equally, physical disorders and imbalances can generate mental disorders. Mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda. Every perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, influences the doshas and affects the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.

## Effects of Emotions on Doshas

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions disturb doshic balance. Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, etc. Increased pitta with anger, envy, hate, etc. Increased kapha with greed, attachment, laziness, etc.

### Emotions and Organs

Grief and sadness with the lungs, anger with the liver, hatred with the gall bladder, fear with the kidneys, grief and sadness with the heart, nervousness with the colon, agitation and temptation with the stomach, and attachment with the spleen.

#### Impact of Emotions on Health

Emotions have a physical and psychological aspect. Unresolved emotions can adversely affect organs, causing stress and weakness, leading to potential diseases.

## Stress in Ayurveda

Ayurveda views stress as a causal factor in disease. Factors like irregular routine, unhealthy diet, negative emotions, and environmental toxins contribute to stress. Stress can trigger various diseases like allergies, asthma, herpes, and heart conditions.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stress and Doshas

Stress can disturb the doshas and lead to imbalances in vata, pitta, or kapha based on an individual's constitution. Vata individuals may experience anxiety, pitta individuals may show anger or suffer from related disorders, while kapha individuals tend to overeat when stressed.

## Minimizing Stress Impact

Part III of the book provides suggestions to reduce the impact of stress on life and alleviate stress-induced symptoms.

## Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

### Examples of Misuse

- Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.
- Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.
- Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.
- Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

### Examples of Underuse

- Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.
- Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

## Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

## Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the balance of the doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain health and prevent disease. It highlights the importance of lifestyle choices in maintaining this balance, even in the face of external factors like seasons and weather.

## How Disease Develops

Illness in Ayurveda is seen as a result of imbalances in the doshas. The disease process involves stages of accumulation, provocation, and pacification of the doshas. Failure to correct aggravated doshas can lead to further imbalances and diseases. Restoring balance through diet and lifestyle changes is key to preventing disease.

## How to Transform Negative Feelings

Ayurveda recognizes the impact of negative emotions on health. Expressing or repressing such feelings can be harmful. Ayurveda suggests acknowledging and experiencing negative emotions fully, allowing them to dissipate naturally. Breathing exercises and mindfulness can help in transforming negative feelings positively.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and controls the body's temperature and energy production.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and stability and is responsible for functions such as lubrication, immunity, and growth.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

When it comes to treating illnesses in Ayurveda, it is important to address the root cause of the imbalance in the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, from accumulation to aggravation, one can take steps to restore balance and promote healing.

### Accumulation Stage

During the accumulation stage, doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites in the body. This is the easiest stage to treat any health problems, as imbalances can be detected early on. Symptoms may include constipation, abdominal distension, heat around the belly button, and feelings of heaviness or lethargy.

### Aggravation Stage

If the doshas continue to build up, they can move into deeper tissues and cause pathological changes, leading to disease. It is important to recognize the signs of aggravation, such as overflowing of doshas in their sites, and take steps to counteract the imbalance through diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies.

## About Doshas

According to Ayurveda, doshas are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. When these doshas accumulate and become imbalanced, they can lead to various health issues.

### Characteristics of Doshas:

- Kapha: Tends to move up into the lungs.
- Pitta: Tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder.
- Vata: Tries to move into the flanks.

## Ayurvedic Therapeutics

The disease process can be addressed at different stages. Specific treatments are required for each stage. In the initial stages, one can use home remedies and apply opposite qualities to reverse the process. However, once the disease progresses beyond the gastrointestinal tract, professional medical help is necessary.

## Spread of Doshas

As the doshas spread from their original sites, they overflow into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. At this stage, eliminating the causal factor alone is not sufficient. A panchakarma purification program or a similar cleansing regimen is needed to restore the doshas to their original sites for excretion from the body.

## Ama, Agni, and the Disease Process

The body's biological fire, known as jatharagni, governs digestion and assimilation. When agni is healthy, it digests, assimilates, and eliminates impurities efficiently. However, imbalances in doshas due to poor diet or lifestyle can affect agni, leading to undigested food particles accumulating in the body and forming toxic substances called ama.

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Governs movement, creativity, and communication.
- Pitta: Governs digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governs stability, strength, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Deposition or Infiltration

The aggravated dosha enters weak or defective organs or tissues, leading to pathological changes. Factors like trauma, genetic predisposition, and emotional stress can contribute to this.

### Manifestation

In this stage, signs and symptoms of the disease become apparent, and the person falls sick. Disease manifests in the area of the defective tissue.

### Cellular Deformity Leading to Structural Distortion

At this stage, the disease is fully developed, and structural changes occur. Complications may arise in other organs or tissues.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent disease.

## The Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is characterized by qualities of air and ether, Pitta by fire and water, and Kapha by earth and water. Each individual has a unique combination of these doshas, which determines their constitution.

### Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Cold, dry, light, and mobile
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, intense, and light
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

In Ayurveda, illness is seen as a process that involves the imbalance of the doshas. By understanding the stages of disease development, one can take preventive measures and treat the illness effectively.

### Six Stages of the Disease Process

1. Leaking tap: The cause of doshic provocation
2. Provocation (Prakopa): Aggravation of doshas
3. Accumulation (Sanchaya): Dosha accumulation in the body
4. Spread (Prasara): Dosha spreading throughout the body
5. Deposition or localization (Sthana samsraya): Dosha manifesting in tissues
6. Destruction (Bheda): Manifestation of signs and symptoms

Awareness and prevention play a key role in maintaining health according to Ayurveda. By understanding one's constitution and making mindful choices in diet and lifestyle, one can prevent the abnormal movement of doshas and promote normal functioning.

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

# Chapter 4: How We Can Stay Healthy

The goal of Ayurveda is to maintain the health of a healthy person and heal the illness of a sick person. Part III of this book contains hundreds of suggestions to help you if you have fallen ill. But staying well is far easier than curing an illness, especially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease process. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this chapter, we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches recommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.

## Awareness

The master key to remaining healthy is awareness. If you know your constitution, and you can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing conditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the food you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.

As we saw in chapter 3, the cause is the concealed effect and the effect is the revealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency of the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the effect, to prevent it from coming to fruition. If a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever, colds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet and eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese, candy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce congestive disorders.)

The knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases like” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore our health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our behavior.

If I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt congested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days. When yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say, “Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my body, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s intelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.

Developing an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-to-moment state of well-being, is the necessary first step to maintaining health.

# Taking Action to Modify the Cause

You can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, rain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a potential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata dosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will increase kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take action. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.

Potential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and on the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts and feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to these changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is called yoga.”

Being smart enough to learn from previous experiences is crucial. Modifying the diet by adding specific seasonings can change the properties of food and make it more suitable for consumption. For example, sensitive individuals can make potatoes more digestible by peeling off the skin and sautéing them with ghee, turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro.

This principle also applies to psychological factors. Recognizing triggers that disturb your doshic balance, such as violent imagery from movies, allows you to make conscious choices to avoid such stimuli and maintain emotional equilibrium.

## Restoring Balance

It all comes down to consciousness and awareness. Understanding your role in various situations, knowing what affects you, and taking appropriate actions are key to restoring and maintaining balance in your mind and body.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Awareness and Prevention

The first step in staying healthy is developing awareness of the potential causes of disease so you can avoid them or deal with them intelligently. The second step is taking action to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is to restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply the opposite quality or qualities.

For example, if you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re agitated or upset, sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your pitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have some sweet cooling fruit.

## Techniques for Cleansing and Purification

When the doshas are aggravated due to poor diet, unhealthy lifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, it affects agni (the body’s biological fire, which governs digestion and assimilation). This can lead to the accumulation of toxins known as ama, which is the root cause of disease.

Ama can cause symptoms like fatigue, constipation, indigestion, gas, and mental confusion. To prevent disease, the key is to help the body eliminate toxins. Ayurveda employs various internal cleansing techniques for this purpose.

One of the key treatments in Ayurveda is Panchakarma, a five-procedure program aimed at detoxifying the body. The program includes preparatory methods like internal oleation with ghee, external oleation with oil massage and sweating, and specific actions to eliminate excess doshas and toxins.

Some of the procedures involved in Panchakarma include therapeutic vomiting (vamana), purgation or laxative therapy (virechana), medicated enema therapy (basti), nasal administration of medication (nasya), and purification of the blood (rakta moksha).

Ayurveda also offers other methods to remove toxins from the body based on the individual's strength and the severity of the disease.

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and ether, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, dry skin, and digestive issues.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls metabolism and digestion. An excess of Pitta can result in inflammation, heartburn, and skin rashes.

Kapha: Influenced by the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs stability and structure. Imbalance in Kapha may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Panchakarma: A powerful cleansing procedure in Ayurveda that is tailored to each individual's constitution and medical condition. It requires close supervision and post-treatment support.

Use of Ghee: Ghee is recommended for internal oleation in most cases, but individuals with high cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar levels should avoid it. Flaxseed oil can be used as an alternative for effective oleation.

Home Purification: Panchakarma can be performed at home for detoxification and prevention of ama buildup. Internal oleation with ghee or flaxseed oil is a key step in the purification process.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation. For the next five to seven days, apply 7 to 8 ounces of warmed (not hot!) oil to your body from head to toe, rubbing it in well. The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and warming; pittas should use sunflower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn oil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.

After the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash with some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as neem. Let some of the oil remain on your skin.

The ancient Ayurvedic textbooks recommend rubbing some chickpea flour over the skin to absorb and help remove the oil. This works very well to remove the oil, but it is more suited to a culture in which individuals bathe outdoors. Today, if you use chickpea flour, be aware that oil, flour, and hot water combine into a formidable mass that can easily clog your plumbing. Flushing the drain with extra hot water immediately following your bath can help.

During your home purification, every night at least one hour after supper take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala. Add about half a cup of boiling water to the triphala powder, and let it steep ten minutes or until it has cooled down, then drink it. Triphala is a mild but effective laxative and can be used for months at a time.

To complete your home panchakarma treatment, on the last three days perform an Ayurvedic medicated enema, or basti, after your hot bath or shower. Use dashamoola tea for the enema. Retain the liquid as long as you comfortably can.

This oleation, sweating, and purgation followed by basti constitute an effective panchakarma that you can easily do on your own at home.

During this entire time, it is important to get plenty of rest and observe a light diet. From day four to day eight, eat only kitchari (equal amounts of basmati rice and mung dal cooked with cumin, mustard seed, and coriander, with about 2 teaspoons of ghee added to it).

Be your own healer. Do this simple home purification, preferably at the junction between seasons. Take responsibility for your own healing. You will start to experience...

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, constipation, and insomnia.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and indigestion.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may cause congestion, lethargy, and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Home remedies in Ayurveda aim not only to treat the symptoms but also to purify the body and prevent future diseases. Rejuvenation and rebuilding are essential aspects of Ayurvedic healing.

### Schedule for Home Panchakarma

Here is an ideal schedule for your home panchakarma purification treatment:

|Day|Internal|External|Oil Bath|Basti|Your Doshic Diet|Diet|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Monday|Monodiet Kitchari|Kitchari with steamed vegetables|Coriander/cumin/fennel tea| | | |

The purpose of panchakarma is not just to get well but to purify and strengthen the body for long-term health. Rejuvenatives like rasayanas promote renewal and longevity at the cellular level.

#### Rejuvenative Herbs

- Vata: Ashwagandha in hot milk twice a day.
- Pitta: Shatavari in warm milk twice a day.
- Kapha: Punarnava in warm water twice a day.

Herbal mixtures like chyavanprash can also be used to tonify the system and enhance overall health.

## Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is at the core of healing. According to Ayurveda, every cell is a center of intelligence and awareness, carrying the sense of self for its own survival. Self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-respect promote cellular intelligence, necessary for proper cell function and immunity.

Modern science is now acknowledging the mind-body connection, a concept deeply rooted in Ayurveda for thousands of years. Our attitudes, feelings, and self-esteem impact our overall well-being. Lack of self-confidence and self-love can be detrimental, as seen in conditions like cancer where cells lose their intelligence.

### Rejuvenation Tips

After completing your panchakarma purification program, take time to build up your strength. Suggestions include:

- Get plenty of rest.
- Observe celibacy to preserve vital energy.
- Follow dietary guidelines based on your constitution.
- Regularly practice meditation and yoga postures.

Additional suggestions for rejuvenative herbs, foods, and tonics are provided in Part III, such as recommendations for "Low Libido" and "Fatigue."

### Important Notes

1. Avoid panchakarma if you are anemic or debilitated.
2. Avoid panchakarma if pregnant.
3. Emotional release may occur post-panchakarma; practice self-care and meditation.

# Understanding Cancer from an Ayurvedic Perspective

In Ayurveda, cancer is seen as a manifestation of imbalances in the body, particularly related to the doshas. Cancerous cells are viewed as separate from the body, having a strong sense of self that is in conflict with healthy cells.

When cancer occurs, it is like a war between the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. Strong self-esteem and self-respect in healthy cells can help in conquering and eliminating cancer cells.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in maintaining immunity. Loving oneself and having confidence can contribute to healing diseases. Cellular immunity and natural resistance are believed to be influenced by self-esteem in Ayurveda.

# Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

# Chapter 5: Ayurvedic Lifestyle: The Ultimate Preventive Medicine

Your daily life plays a crucial role in determining your health and overall experience. It is within your control and consists of choices that either enhance your well-being or deplete it. Factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and daily habits significantly impact your mental and physical health.

## In Tune with Nature

Ayurveda emphasizes living in harmony with nature. The ancient sages recognized the profound connection between human life and the natural world. Aligning with the rhythms and cycles of nature, such as day and night and seasonal changes, is essential for optimal health.

Living in tune with nature also involves understanding your unique constitution or prakruti. This includes recognizing your physical, mental, and emotional makeup to determine your dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, and other lifestyle factors that suit your individual nature.

By following Ayurvedic principles and maintaining balance with nature, you can promote overall well-being and prevent disease.

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

# Inner Ecology - Ayurvedic Daily Routine

A daily routine is essential for maintaining good health and for transforming our body, mind, and consciousness to a higher level of functioning. A regulated daily routine puts us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and helps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long life.

Waking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress, and untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in sleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine, brings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.

Our body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda, every organ has a definite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time. Midday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late afternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.

This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

- 6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha
- 10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta
- 2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata
- 6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha
- 10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

## Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

## Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.

I am healing and I am healed.

## Wash Your Face, Mouth, and Eyes

Splash your face with cold water, rinse out your mouth, wash your eyes with cool water, and gently massage the eyelids by rubbing them.

Blink your eyes seven times, and then rotate your eyes in all directions: side to side, up and down, diagonally, clockwise, and counterclockwise. This helps in feeling alert and fresh.

### Drinking Water

Drink a glass of room-temperature water from a pure copper cup. Avoid cold water, especially for kapha individuals. Hot water is beneficial for kapha and vata types, while lukewarm water is suitable for pitta.

### Evacuation

Sit or squat on the toilet for a bowel movement. Develop a habit of evacuating daily after drinking warm water. Maintain hygiene by washing the anal area and hands.

### Oral Hygiene

Use a soft toothbrush and herbal tooth powder for cleaning teeth. Scrape your tongue every morning to assess your health. Coated tongue or bad breath may indicate digestive issues or toxicity.

## Daily Regimen for Better Health

If there is ama on the tongue and a bad smell on the breath, don’t eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is not good if you have not digested last night’s dinner. By following this routine, you come in contact with your body and observe the functioning of your system. This knowledge gives you the power to create better health by altering your behavior.

## Tongue Scraping

To scrape your tongue, use a stainless-steel tongue scraper or a spoon. Gently scrape from the back or base of the tongue forward, until you have scraped the whole surface (seven to fourteen strokes). Tongue scraping removes bacteria from the tongue, stimulates gastric fire, and digestive enzymes.

## Gargle for Oral Health

To strengthen the teeth, gums, and jaw, gargle twice a day with warm sesame oil. Swish the oil around vigorously in your mouth, then spit it out and gently massage the gums with your index finger.

## Nose Drops (Nasya)

Put 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee, brahmi ghee, or sesame oil into each nostril. This helps clean the sinuses, improve voice, vision, and mental clarity. Nose drops are beneficial in dry climates and during cold winters to keep the nostrils lubricated.

## Oil Massage for Well-Being

Take 4 or 5 ounces of warm oil and rub it all over your head and body. Massaging the scalp with oil can prevent headaches, slow balding and graying of hair, and induce sound sleep. Oil massage improves circulation, calms the mind, and reduces excess vata.

## Best Oils by Body Type

For Ayurvedic oil massage, use specific oils according to your body type.

## Ayurveda and Doshas

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with characteristics like dryness, coldness, and lightness. Recommended oil for Vata is sesame oil.
- Pitta: Linked to qualities such as heat, intensity, and sharpness. Sunflower oil is recommended for Pitta.
- Kapha: Characterized by heaviness, slowness, and stability. Corn oil is suggested for Kapha individuals.

## Exercise Recommendations

Exercise is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being according to Ayurveda. Different doshas benefit from varying types and intensities of exercise:

### Vata Individuals:

Vata individuals are advised to engage in quieter exercises like walking, easy swimming, or yoga asanas. Yoga stretching, including specific postures, can help calm Vata.

### Pitta Individuals:

Moderate exercises like swimming are beneficial for Pitta individuals. Specific yoga postures can help cool Pitta and should be preferred over strenuous activities.

### Kapha Individuals:

Kapha individuals can benefit from more strenuous exercises like jogging, aerobics, or hiking. These activities help balance the heavier nature of Kapha.

Avoid straining during exercise and aim to work up to half of your capacity. Yoga stretching is recommended for all body types, with specific postures tailored to each dosha.

Remember to consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner before starting any new exercise routine to ensure it aligns with your unique constitution.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the proper role of sex in our lives as a creative force for sharing love and compassion, with recommendations based on constitutional types (doshas).

## Ideal Wake-up and Bed Times

| |VATA|PITTA|KAPHA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wake Up|6:00|5:30|4:30|
|Go to Bed|10:00|10:00-11:00|1:00-midnight|

## Sexual Activity and Doshas

Kaphas can engage in sexual activity 2-3 times a week, vatas once or at most twice a month, and pittas every two weeks. Too-frequent lovemaking depletes ojas and aggravates vata dosha.

## Restoring Ojas

After sexual activity, a massage and nourishing drinks like almond milk can help restore ojas. The recommended time for lovemaking is between 10 and 11 PM.

## Seasonal Routines

Living in harmony with the natural cycles of vata, pitta, and kapha throughout the seasons is essential for maintaining good health. Adjusting food choices, exercise, clothing, and other habits accordingly is key.

"I set more store by a good regimen that maintains my humors in balance and procures me a sound sleep. Drink hot when it freezes, drink cool in the dog days; in everything, neither too much nor too little; digest, sleep, have pleasure, and snap your fingers at the rest of it." —Voltaire

Remember that Ayurveda is based on natural cycles, so observing nature is crucial for understanding the seasons and adapting your lifestyle accordingly.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Understanding Doshas

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Pitta is associated with fire and water elements, and individuals with a predominant Pitta dosha should focus on keeping cool during the summer season to prevent aggravation of Pitta dosha.

## Guidelines for Summer

Summer is characterized by hot and bright weather, making it the season of Pitta dosha. To maintain balance during summer:

- Rub coconut oil or sunflower oil on the body before bathing to stay cool and soothe the skin.
- Wear cotton or silk clothing in light colors like white, gray, blue, purple, and green to stay cool.
- Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet including fruits like apples, pears, melons, and plums, and avoid heating foods like garlic, onion, and sour fruits.
- Avoid hot drinks and opt for room-temperature or cool beverages like cool lassi for refreshment.
- Cook during cooler times of the day to avoid aggravating Pitta dosha.

By following these guidelines and practices, individuals can maintain balance and harmony with the Pitta dosha during the summer season.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Summer

If you customarily drink alcoholic beverages, avoid whiskey, brandy, rum, and red wine, which are heating. Some cool beer during hot days will be all right.

This is a season of generalized low energy. Thus it is all right to take a short nap in the daytime.

If you have to work outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat.

Wear sunglasses outdoors during the brightest part of the day. Lenses should be smoky gray or green, not red or yellow and especially not blue or purple, which will damage the eyes.

If you can, work indoors. Have some air conditioning in your car and in your room or office.

Never lie in the sun in summer. If the weather is very hot, don’t wear shorts or short sleeves, but wear loose-fitting clothing to protect your skin. No person having multiple moles should lie in the sun; it may provoke extreme pitta aggravation and lead to skin cancer.

If you feel really hot, take a swim in a cool lake or pool, then drink a little lime juice in water.

Avoid strenuous exercise. If you are accustomed to running or other vigorous aerobic exercise, do it early in the morning at the coolest part of the day.

Do some mild yoga exercises and quiet meditation twice a day. Good postures for summer include the Fish, Camel, Boat, Cobra, Cow, and Palm Tree poses. Pitta individuals should not do inverted poses such as Headstand and Shoulder Stand, which can be pitta-provoking. Also, do the Moon Salutation.

Perform shitali pranayama, a cooling breathing exercise described in chapter 6.

Certain jewelry and gems will help cool pitta. These include a necklace of sandalwood beads, a jade or pearl necklace, amethyst crystals, moonstone, malachite crystals, and any silver jewelry.

In the evening, after dinner, go for a walk in the moonlight. Dress in white clothes, with white flowers in your hair or a garland of white flowers around your neck.

You can go to bed a little later on summer nights, around 11 P.M. or midnight. Rub some coconut oil on your scalp and the soles of your feet for a cooling effect before going to sleep. Sleep on your right side.

Sandalwood, jasmine, and khus oils are cooling and are good fragrances to wear in the summer. Also, place a few drops of sandalwood oil on your pillow, and you will be sleeping with sandalwood perfume all night.

Sex should be minimized in the summer, as it is heating and will provoke pitta. If you want to have sex, do it between 9 and 10 P.M., when it is cooler but not yet pitta time.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Dry, light, cold, and rough. Imbalance can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Heavy, slow, steady, and solid. Imbalance may manifest as weight gain, congestion, and lethargy.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

This book provides a comprehensive guide to various illnesses and their ayurvedic remedies. It includes guidelines for different seasons like summer and fall to help maintain doshic balance.

### Summer Guidelines

During summer, pitta aggravation is common due to the hot and dry qualities in the atmosphere. To balance pitta, it is recommended to consume sweet, cold, liquid, and fatty foods. Avoid excessive exercise, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods. Enjoy nature and cool water to stay balanced.

### Fall Guidelines

Autumn provokes vata dosha with its dry, light, cold, and windy qualities. To pacify vata, wake up early, practice specific yoga poses, meditate, and use warm sesame oil for self-massage. Stick to warm, grounding foods like grains, soups, and stews. Avoid salads and opt for herbal teas instead of caffeinated drinks.

Consult a qualified ayurvedic practitioner before trying any remedies mentioned in this book.

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

# Chapter 6: Breathing Techniques

Prana is the bridge between body, mind, and consciousness. It is the constant movement of awareness. Prana carries awareness to the object of our perception; that movement of awareness through prana is called attention. The internal movement of prana is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus prana and mind are deeply connected.

The physical manifestation of prana is breath. Breathing and mind are closely connected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is the psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and every breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent, breathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the breathing is irregular and interrupted.

Ancient Vedic seers (rishis) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing and mental activity and uncovered the art of pranayama. Pranayama equals prana plus ayam. Ayam means “to control,” prana is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can control mental activity.

## The Secret of Pranayama

The rishis also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath cycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left nostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens about every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left side of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the right hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the left brain.

The left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left brain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and judgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is dominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right hemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which is associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an artist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the right brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a problem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.
---
# Pranayama and Alternate Nostril Breathing

# The Secret of Pranayama

The secret of pranayama is the secret of handling the male and female energy operating in our nervous system. In Alternate Nostril pranayama, when we inhale through the left nostril, we charge the right brain. When we inhale through the right nostril, we charge our left brain. When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male and female energies become equally balanced. When these energies are balanced, the neutral energy is awakened and one experiences pure awareness, which is called brahman.

When we do pranayama, the nadis (subtle channels of the nervous system) become purified, the mind becomes controlled, and we can go beyond male and female energies to pure, choiceless, passive awareness. This is the basis for pranayama. Then there are numerous types of pranayama: practices to heat or cool the body; Right Nostril breathing to awaken more male energy; Left Nostril breathing to awaken more female energy; and so on.

## Six Breathing Techniques

### ALTERNATE NOSTRIL PRANAYAMA

One of the simplest breathing practices, and one that is very effective, as we have discussed, is Alternate Nostril pranayama.

1. Sit comfortably on the floor in a cross-legged posture, keeping the spine straight. If you are not comfortable in this position, sit upright on the front edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Close the right nostril with your right thumb, and inhale through the left nostril. Inhale into the belly, not into the chest.
3. After inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment.
4. Exhale through your right nostril while closing the left with the ring and little finger of your right hand.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3, but this time start by inhaling through the right nostril (while you close the left nostril with your ring and little finger).

You can do this breathing exercise for five to ten minutes.

NOTE: This pranayama, as well as the others in this book, is best learned under the guidance of an accomplished teacher.

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness. It emphasizes the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain good health.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata dosha is associated with movement, creativity, and flexibility. When imbalanced, it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and digestive issues.
- Pitta: Represented by the elements of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism, digestion, and energy production. Imbalance in Pitta can result in anger, inflammation, and skin problems.
- Kapha: Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha dosha is responsible for structure, stability, and lubrication in the body. When out of balance, it may cause lethargy, weight gain, and respiratory issues.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Alternate Nostril Pranayama

Inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril. This pranayama technique helps balance the flow of energy in the body and promotes relaxation.

### Shitali Pranayama (Cooling Breath)

To perform Shitali Pranayama, curl your tongue into a tube and inhale slowly through it. This breath cools the body, pacifies high Pitta, and improves digestion and blood pressure.

### Bhastrika Pranayama (Breath of Fire)

Bhastrika Pranayama involves active exhalation and passive inhalation to increase lung capacity and strengthen the respiratory system. It is beneficial for allergies, asthma, and overall lung health.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# SHITALI PRANAYAMA (COOLING BREATH)

On inhalation, constrict the epiglottis to create a humming sound. On exhalation, the sound is long and low. The inhalation, which is more high-pitched, is traditionally said to be like a female bee; the exhalation, which has a deeper sound, like a male bee.

If you find it difficult to make the humming sound on the inhalation, just inhale naturally, take a deep breath into the belly, and then do the humming on the exhalation.

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

# Chapter 7 - Meditation and Mental Discipline

Meditation is an art of bringing harmony to body, mind, and consciousness. Life with meditation is a flowering of bliss and beauty. Life without meditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.

During ancient times, meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly, meditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice certain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation and mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever technique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by your teacher, please do that.

But what is meditation, and what is not?

Meditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow mind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into any subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to fly an airplane. We need it. But not in meditation.

In concentration, we build a wall of resistance, and in the effort to control the mind, we lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re finished, they feel tired, because for that hour they were fighting and fighting, negating everything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.

Concentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open, choiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while concentration says no to everything.

Concentration is effort. Wherever there is effort, there is a maker of the effort. The maker of the effort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the effort. The more the concentration, the more ego.

In meditation, there is no effort and no effort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You are just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry of a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it to come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is peripheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.

In listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking or disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you. Follow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don’t resist. Then a magical phenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.

## Ayurveda and Meditation

When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No effort, no resistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into peace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.

Look at any object, a tree, a flower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking, no judgment, just choiceless observation.

Awareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No effort is required, no concentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given to you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.

In expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one simply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love. Individual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time and thought.

In that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a breeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature—love, bliss, beauty, and awareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One becomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.

This is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning is called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting everything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has a right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore discipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no discipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.

The so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But a mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And discipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes a celebration.

When you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or Half Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on a chair but keep your vertebral column erect.

With persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one, two, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day, enlightenment will soon come.

Sitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and thinking automatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond suffering, because it is thought that creates suffering.

## Empty Bowl Meditation

Sit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees.

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and gently close your eyes. Place your hands on your knees with palms facing up, like empty bowls. Open your mouth slightly, and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, behind the front teeth.

Start by focusing on your breath. Let your lungs breathe naturally without any effort on your part. Observe the movement of your breath - the inhalation and exhalation.

Be mindful of the sensation of air touching the inside of your nostrils during inhalation and exhalation. Notice the coolness of the ingoing air and the warmth of the outgoing air. Stay present in the moment as you watch your breath.

After a few minutes, begin to follow the breath as it moves through your body. Follow the air as you inhale, tracing its path from the nose to the lungs, heart, and down to the belly button where there is a natural pause. Then follow the exhalation back up the body and out through the nose.

Focus on the two stops - one behind the belly button and the other about nine inches in front of the nose. These stops are key to stilling the mind and experiencing a sense of timelessness.

By entering into these stops and quieting the mind, you can connect with a deeper sense of peace and tranquility. Practice this meditation for 15 minutes in the morning and evening to gradually increase your awareness and inner stillness.

NOTE: If preferred, this meditation can also be practiced in a prone position for added comfort.

# So-Hum Meditation

# So-Hum Meditation

In So-Hum meditation we sit quietly and watch our breath, as in the Empty Bowl meditation, but we add the sound So on inhalation, Hum on exhalation. (Only silently; we don’t speak the sounds aloud.)

When sound, breath, and awareness come together, it becomes light. We have seen that every atom radiates light and heat energy, which is a quantum wave. The moment we pay attention to our breath and start feeling So-Hum, So-Hum along with the breath, our breath becomes a quantum wave and radiates light. You may see that light of life at the third eye.

Inspiration (breathing in) is living; expiration (breathing out) is dying. When a child is born, with its first breath life expresses itself with inspiration. When someone dies, we say he has expired. The breath has gone out.

Hum means “I” or “individual ego”; So means “He, the Divine.” So in the natural course of So-Hum meditation, when So goes in, life energy goes in and Hum, ego, our limited individuality, goes out. That is the significance of So-Hum meditation. When you inhale So, you are inhaling life. When you exhale Hum, you are exhaling ego and limitation.

So-Hum meditation properly practiced leads to the union of the individual with the universal Cosmic Consciousness. You will go beyond thought, beyond time and space, beyond cause and effect. Limitations will vanish. Your consciousness will empty itself, and in that emptying it will expand and peace and joy will descend as a benediction.

## Double-Arrowed Attention (Witnessing)

# Witnessing Awareness

# Witnessing Awareness

In Vedic science, witnessing is called samyag darshan. This is a process of looking outward and inward simultaneously.

When we look at a tree, a star, a mountain, or a flower, something goes out from our eyes, touches the object, and comes back to us. That which goes out of our eyes in order to touch the object of perception, we call attention. Ayurveda says that attention happens when prana goes out and carries the vibration of awareness toward the object. Thus, attention is awareness plus prana, movement.

One arrow goes out and touches the object. At the same time, a second arrow of attention should go inside, toward the center of our heart, to observe the observer. At the time of looking, when you look at the object outside, at the same time, look at the looker; watch the watcher; observe the observer. What happens when the watcher is watched is that the watcher disappears. This simple watching, without a watcher, is called witnessing. In that witnessing, you develop intimacy, relationship, with the object of perception.

WITNESSING AWARENESS

# Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

# Chapter 8: Ayurvedic Dietary Guidelines

The purpose of this chapter is to help you choose a suitable diet for balance, harmony, and health in your life, based on Ayurvedic principles. Health-conscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their healing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can make a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible for poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.

The Ayurvedic tradition offers much insight into what food will suit and balance each individual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations that will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to avoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics, except specific guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this chapter. (Interested readers may consult Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing by Usha Lad and Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices and herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious recipes.)

## Food Guidelines for the Constitutional Types

What you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding what to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the qualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or aggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the taste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its qualities are heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know whether the food is cooling or heating (virya), and its postdigestive effect (vipaka).

If you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully comprehend these factors (see the Reading List). Otherwise, the following charts take these factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.

The charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here are a few points to remember:

- Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked “yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create balance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that is currently aggravated or increased.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (related to air and space), Pitta (related to fire and water), and Kapha (related to earth and water). Each dosha has specific characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Ayurveda offers a wide range of remedies for various illnesses, ranging from common colds to chronic conditions. By understanding the doshas and their interactions, Ayurvedic remedies aim to restore balance and promote overall health.

## The Six Tastes

Taste plays a crucial role in Ayurveda, directly impacting the doshas. There are six tastes recognized by Ayurveda: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Each taste corresponds to specific elements and has a unique effect on the body's systems.

For example:
- Earth + Water = Sweet
- Earth + Fire = Sour
- Water + Fire = Salty
- Fire + Air = Pungent (Spicy)
- Air + Space = Bitter
- Air + Earth = Astringent

The taste buds on the tongue are sensitive to these six tastes, sending signals to the brain that influence digestion, doshas, and overall bodily functions.

Vata: Characterized by qualities of dry, light, cold, rough, subtle, and mobile.

Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, liquid, and oily.

Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, and oily.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Sweet Taste

The sweet taste is present in foods such as rice, sugar, milk, wheat, dates, and maple syrup. It increases the vital essence of life and promotes growth of all seven dhatus. Proper use gives strength and longevity.

Benefits: Encourages the senses, improves complexion, promotes healthy skin, hair, and voice, relieves thirst and burning sensations, and promotes stability.

Excessive use may lead to disorders like colds, cough, congestion, heaviness, obesity, diabetes, and more.

### Sour Taste

The sour taste is found in foods like citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented food. It stimulates appetite, improves digestion, and energizes the body when used in moderation.

Effects of Excess: Excessive use can cause thirst, hyperacidity, heartburn, ulcers, skin conditions, and acid pH imbalance in the body.

### Salty Taste

Examples include sea salt, rock salt, and kelp. Salt, when used moderately, relieves vata, increases pitta and kapha, promotes growth, and aids digestion.

Caution: Too much salt may lead to thickening of blood, hypertension, skin issues, water retention, and other health problems.

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach that includes diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is associated with specific characteristics and governs different functions in the body. Imbalance in the doshas can lead to various health issues.

## Effects of Tastes on the Doshas

The tastes have different effects on the doshas. For individuals with a Vata constitution, bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes should be avoided in excess as they can increase air and cause gas. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes are beneficial for Vata constitution.

### How the Tastes Affect the Doshas

|Taste|Vata|Pitta|Kapha|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Good| | |
|Sour| | | |
|Salty| | | |
|Pungent|Avoid| | |
|Bitter|Avoid| | |
|Astringent|Avoid| | |

## Herbs and the Six Tastes

The taste of an herb plays a crucial role in its therapeutic value. Ayurvedic herbs are often consumed in forms that allow their taste to be experienced, as each taste has specific effects on the body. Bitter and astringent tastes, though less preferred, are important for balancing the body.

When herbs are encapsulated to mask their taste, the benefits derived from the taste are diminished. Ayurvedic physicians prescribe herbs based on the taste needed to balance the body, ensuring the effects are transmitted effectively.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Medicine and Doshas

In Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are classified based on their predominant taste, secondary aftertaste, and potential taste. The main taste affects the rasa dhatu, the aftertaste impacts the nervous system, and the third taste has a heating or cooling effect. It is important to consider the taste of medications when taking Ayurvedic remedies.

## Doshas and Tastes

Pitta: Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances as they can aggravate bodily fire. Beneficial tastes for pittas include sweet, bitter, and astringent.

Kapha: Kapha individuals should steer clear of sweet, sour, and salty foods as they increase bodily water. Foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes are better suited for kapha dosha.

## Healthy Eating Habits

How you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some healthy eating habits to cultivate:

- Choose foods according to your constitution and the season.
- Eat fresh, sattvic food of the best quality you can afford.
- Only eat when you feel hungry and drink when you feel thirsty.
- Sit down to eat and focus on your meal without distractions.
- Chew your food well, at least 32 times per mouthful.
- Eat at a moderate speed and avoid gobbling your food.
- Fill one-third of your stomach with food, one-third with water, and leave one-third empty.

### Conclusion

Following these Ayurvedic principles can help maintain balance in your doshas and promote overall well-being. Remember to listen to your body and make mindful choices in your diet and lifestyle.

## Unhealthy Eating Habits

Don’t eat more at a meal than the amount of food you can hold in two cupped hands. Overeating expands the stomach so that you will feel the need for additional food. Overeating also creates toxins in the digestive tract.

During meals, don’t drink iced drinks or fruit juice, sip a little warm water between mouthfuls of food.

Honey should never be cooked. If it is cooked, the molecules become like a glue that adheres to mucous membranes and clogs the subtle channels, producing toxins.

- Eating too soon after a full meal
- Drinking too much water, or no water, during a meal
- Drinking very chilled water during a meal, or indeed at any time
- Eating when constipated
- Eating at the wrong time of day, either too early or too late
- Eating too much heavy food or too little light food
- Eating fruit or drinking fruit juice with a meal
- Eating without real hunger
- Emotional eating
- Eating incompatible food combinations
- Munching between meals

### Incompatible Food Combinations

The shelves of pharmacies and health food stores these days are lined with digestive aids and pills for indigestion and gas. It is likely that most of these gastrointestinal problems begin with poor food combining.

According to Ayurveda, certain food combinations disturb the normal functioning of the gastric fire and upset the balance of the doshas. Combining foods improperly can produce indigestion, fermentation, putrefaction, and gas formation.

The following table lists some (but far from all) of the incompatible food combinations worth avoiding:

You can alleviate some of the ill effects of these combinations by using spices and herbs in your cooking. A strong digestive fire can be

# How to Use the Encyclopedia

The ancient Ayurvedic art of healing deals with every individual’s life as a whole. To the Ayurvedic vaidya (physician), every individual is an indivisible, complete, unique being. Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a concurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental changes, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, financial status, and relationships. To remain healthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.

When the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is disturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the symptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.

The purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications, dietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing exercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the symptoms. Dealing directly with emergency or life-threatening symptoms is crucial, but addressing the fundamental causes of the illness is essential to prevent recurrence.

## Components of Ayurvedic Healing

The Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as chikitsa (disease management) and traditionally consists of eight components. Chikitsa is a complete healing program that begins with identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by purifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and revitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems to prevent recurrence.

Illness is unlikely to be completely healed unless the behaviors that gave rise to it are changed. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle, unresolved emotions, and insufficient exercise are common factors at the root of most illnesses. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential components of the healing process.

For each condition, the book suggests not only medications but also various measures for healing, such as specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and other ways to promote healing.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health that focuses on creating harmony with nature through diet and daily routines. It emphasizes the body's innate healing mechanisms and natural processes of healing.

## Doshas and Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha, each with unique characteristics that influence an individual's constitution and health. Understanding one's dosha is essential for personalized health management.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

The Ayurvedic approach to disease management includes identifying the individual's constitution and current state of doshas, determining the causes of illness, and providing tailored treatments such as diet, exercise, detoxification, rejuvenation, and specific therapies.

## Diagnosis and Treatment

Accurate diagnosis based on the dosha involved (vata, pitta, or kapha) is crucial for effective Ayurvedic treatment. Careful observation of physical signs and symptoms helps in selecting the appropriate remedy for the specific condition.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Ayurveda Overview: Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health that originated in India thousands of years ago. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - to maintain overall well-being.

## Doshas and Characteristics:

- Vata: Characteristics include dryness, coldness, lightness, and mobility.
- Pitta: Characteristics include heat, intensity, lightness, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heaviness, coldness, softness, and stability.

## Important Notes:

Herbal Medications: Ayurveda offers a vast pharmacopoeia of herbal preparations for various conditions. Simple remedies using common kitchen herbs or household strategies are recommended.

Experimentation: Try different remedies for a specific condition and observe how your body responds. Adjust the treatment based on the results.

Correct Diagnosis: If a remedy doesn't work as expected, reassess your diagnosis. Consider trying remedies for a different dosha that aligns better with your symptoms.

Treating Your Condition: Focus on treating the actual imbalance or illness based on your symptoms rather than just your constitutional type.

Duration of Remedies: Use remedies until your symptoms improve, and adjust or change them as needed.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

This book provides detailed information about Ayurveda, the doshas, their characteristics, and a comprehensive guide to A-Z illnesses and their remedies.

## Important Factors for Healing

The duration of healing in Ayurveda depends on factors such as the severity of the disease, its duration, and the individual's motivation to get well. Diligence in following the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective results.

## Lifestyle Changes

Ayurvedic remedies should be complemented with lifestyle changes including diet, daily routine, and exercise to address the underlying causes of the condition. Simply taking herbs may not be sufficient to overcome ingrained behavior patterns.

## Consulting a Doctor

If symptoms persist despite remedies and lifestyle changes, consulting a doctor is recommended. Chronic conditions may require more time for healing, and it's essential to use common sense in determining the duration of treatment.

## Cautions

It is important to consult a medical doctor for serious conditions. Ayurvedic remedies can complement medical treatment but should not replace it. Always inform your physician about any additional remedies being used and seek their supervision.

## Determine the Severity of the Disease

The majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be treated at home using natural means like lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple yoga stretching exercises. However, it is crucial to seek medical attention from a qualified physician or trained hospital staff in serious cases.

For instance, conditions like severe dehydration due to prolonged diarrhea or high fever accompanied by delirium and loss of consciousness require immediate hospitalization and professional medical care.

Always be vigilant about the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease and seek appropriate treatment. When in doubt, consult a doctor as non-medical professionals may not always accurately assess the situation.

### A Word About Licorice Tea

Licorice tea is recommended in certain situations, such as relieving an asthma attack. However, individuals with hypertension should use it cautiously for emergencies only, as regular consumption may lead to sodium retention and potentially increase blood pressure.

## Acne

Acne is the result of high pitta moving under the skin and breaking out in pimples. Ayurveda recommends several natural approaches that, taken together, can effectively control acne.

The possible pitta-provoking causes are numerous. They include emotional stress, premenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The problem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to find out the cause, so it can be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply avoided.

### FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET

Because acne is a pitta condition, the first step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet detailed in chapter 8. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt, fried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.

### USE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA

The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess pitta that causes acne:

- kutki
- guduchi
- shatavari

Make a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start with 1 teaspoon of each), and take ¼ teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a day. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm water.

A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. After each meal, steep ⅓ teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.

### DRINK BLUE WATER

Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some translucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some grocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the water each day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect. Believe it or not, it works!

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

# Healing Pastes for Your Skin

Here are three pastes you can make at home and apply to your skin. They can be effective in reducing acne.

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (available at Indian grocery stores and natural food stores) with enough water to make a paste, and wash your face with this mixture. Rinse off, then apply either of the following:
2. Mix almond powder with a little water, and apply the paste to your face. Let it dry and remain on your skin for up to half an hour, then rinse it off. (You can easily make the almond powder yourself in a coffee or nut grinder.)
3. A paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk is healing for the skin. Take ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, mix them together, and add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste. Apply this mixture to your face.

Note: Your face will look yellow for some time—up to 5 days—but this formula is quite effective in alleviating acne.

Drink Aloe Vera Juice: You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a day.

Keep Your Colon Clean: Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins from the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb amalaki, ½ to 1 teaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down with warm water.

Apply Melon: Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its cooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.

Yoga Postures: Recommended yoga asanas for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence of postures called the Moon Salutation. (See appendix 4 for illustrations.)

Breathing Exercise: Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help to reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing through the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right nostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is blocked, don’t force it; try again later.

Relax Your Face: Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and place both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial muscles and increase the blood supply.

You can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the heart of the palm to the eyelashes. Our eyelashes are intensely electrically charged; they take that warmth and relieve the pitta under the skin that is coming out in the form of...

# Acne

VISUALIZATION: The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One effective way to relieve that stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and going away—as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting out in acne. This works.

A final suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the acne.

See also “Smoking” Addictions

Addictions: Why are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as babies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are addicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is difficult and unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulfilling, they may be dissatisfied and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the situation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.

Whether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it soon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency. Then, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the person’s brain doesn’t function properly.

Treatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder addictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that is difficult to deal with.

CLEANSING: To effectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do panchakarma, an effective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See chapter 4 for a description of panchakarma treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a home panchakarma program you can do for yourself.

DOSE REDUCTION: Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the addictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are available to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive substance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.

With nicotine toxicity (which affects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and alcohol toxicity (which affects the liver) we have to strengthen the affected organs. For alcohol toxicity, use this formula:

- chitrak 3 parts

## Kutki Remedy

Take ½ teaspoon of kutki, 3 parts aloe vera juice, 3 times a day.

## Herbal Wine for Alcohol Addiction

Ayurveda suggests a bitter wine made of aloe vera juice (kumari asava) as a substitute for hard liquor. Gradually reduce the amount of herbal wine while using a herbal formula to strengthen the liver.

## Tobacco Addiction Remedy

For nicotine addiction, replace one-third to one-half of tobacco in each cigarette with a mixture of rose petals, brahmi, and jatamamsi. Smoke until the tobacco starts burning and then discard the cigarette.

## Nasal Medicine

Using brahmi ghee for nasya can help reduce nicotine toxicity.

## Exercise

Engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, or exercising when feeling the urge to drink or smoke.

## Seek Medical Help

If experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, tremors, or drowsiness, seek medical assistance immediately.

## Appetite Stimulation

Instead of alcohol, stimulate appetite with ginger tea or Agni Tea made with cayenne pepper, ginger root, sweetener, rock salt, and lime juice.

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

# Treatment for Vata-Type Allergies

According to Ayurvedic samprapti (pathogenesis), allergies are a doshic reaction to a specific allergen, such as pollen, dust, chemicals on a rug, ragweed, or any strong chemical smell. These allergic reactions are classified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type.

Vata-type allergies are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort, or even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing, headache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when exposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of the bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and other vata-type symptoms.

In a pitta type of allergy, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person comes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic fibers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities and creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type allergic reactions.

Kapha allergies are often experienced during the spring season when plants and trees shed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other flower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people, they irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a cough, sinus infection, and even asthma.

In order to treat allergies effectively, first we have to find out whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.

In most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your prakruti (constitution) predicts your allergy proneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution and the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta prakruti is more likely to have a pitta allergic reaction, especially when the vikruti or current status of the system shows a pitta imbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions, emotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so forth.

## Basti

One of the most effective remedies for vata-type allergies is a dashamoola tea basti (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound dashamoola in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing, dryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this dashamoola tea basti.

## Herbal Remedies for Vata Allergies

Use this herbal formula:

- Ashwagandha 1 part
- Bala 1 part
- Vidari 1 part

Mix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3 times a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.

To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or licorice tea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to 10 drops of mahanarayan oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. If you do not have mahanarayan oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies:

- Shatavari 8 parts
- Kama dudha ½ part
- Guduchi 1 part
- Shanka bhasma ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little warm water.

For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply neem oil or tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) on the skin.

## Blood Purification

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high pitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer season, do rakta moksha, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this practice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India, as it has proven to be an effective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it today, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank. That will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.

To produce a similar effect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

## Treatment for Pitta-Type Allergies

To cleanse the blood and help heal pitta-type allergies, mix the herbs manjistha and neem in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

Another effective blood purifier is burdock. Make a tea from ½ teaspoon burdock per cup of boiling water and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.

## Treatment for Kapha-Type Allergies

Herbal Remedies: For relief from respiratory-pulmonary congestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever caused by kapha allergies, use the following herbal formula:

- sitopaladi 4 parts
- yashti madhu 4 parts
- abrak bhasma ⅛ part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.

Purgation Therapy: To relieve kapha congestion in the stomach and lungs, consider purgation therapy using flaxseed oil. Take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day for 2 or 3 days. Triphala can also be used for this purpose.

Vomiting Therapy: Vamana, or vomiting therapy, is effective for removing excess kapha but may not be suitable for everyone due to cultural and emotional considerations. If you decide to try it, follow the procedure carefully. However, if you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, avoid vamana therapy.

Important Caution: If you have specific health conditions like high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal hernia, or heart problems, it is advised not to undergo vamana therapy.

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

# Healing Guidelines for All Types of Allergies

USE TRIPHALA. For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Triphala acts as both a laxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Haritaki works on vata dosha, amalaki on pitta dosha, and bibhitaki on kapha dosha.

DIETARY CHANGES. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy, the pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines may be found in chapter 8.)

WATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat incompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and dairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes and “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities, please turn to this page.

AVOID THE CAUSE. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the allergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should simply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic fibers such as polyester and rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing. Because of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might consider using only organic cotton products, though they tend to be more expensive.

BLOCK THE ALLERGENS. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other allergens. One way to minimize the effect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to lubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the allergen with the mucous membrane.

USE NEEM OIL. Another way to reduce or avoid the effect of environmental allergens is to apply neem oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as well as the disinfectant properties of neem, will minimize contact with the allergen.

NOTE: Use neem herbalized oil—that is, neem leaves cooked in a base of sesame or another oil. Pure neem extract will be too strong. If you find that even this herbalized neem oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation, mix it half and half with coconut oil.

MEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance is created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to restore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See chapter 7 for guidelines.)

YOGA POSTURES. The most helpful yoga asana for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun Salutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation. For help with yoga asanas, see appendix 4.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Breathing Exercises

Alternate Nostril breathing is effective for respiratory allergies such as hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. Bhastrika (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type congestive allergies. Ujjayi pranayama helps to improve immunity and is beneficial for all types of allergies.

## Anemia

Modern medicine has delineated several types of anemia including iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia. Certain bleeding disorders can also lead to anemia due to blood loss. Ayurveda classifies anemia under vata type, pitta type, and kapha type, focusing on how the anemia manifests in an individual.

### Types of Anemia

- Vata-type anemia: Thin appearance, dry skin, cracking joints, breathlessness, constipation, and tarry black stool.
- Pitta-type anemia: Yellowish eyes, high-colored urine, dark brown stools, nausea or pain in liver/spleen area, dizziness, and irritability.
- Kapha-type anemia: Edema, cold clammy skin, shiny appearance, and skin reflection due to swelling.

#### Treatment for Vata-Type Anemia

For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking tikta ghrita.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

## Vata-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Take one teaspoon of tikta ghrita 5 to 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner to improve blood volume.

2. Mix kaishore guggulu, abrak bhasma, ashwagandha, and dashamoola. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to correct vata-type anemia.

3. Try gandharva haritaki, which is haritaki powder roasted in castor oil. Take ½ teaspoon at bedtime with warm water for 2 months or until blood returns to normal.

## Pitta-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use shatavari ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of shatavari ghee 3 times a day before meals.

2. Mix shatavari, brahmi, neem, and loha bhasma. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with aloe vera gel to treat pitta-type anemia.

## Kapha-Type Anemia Remedies:

1. Use punarnava, gokshura, and kutki for swelling associated with kapha-type anemia.

NOTE: Adjust dosages if experiencing any discomfort or side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anemia

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture twice a day with a few sips of warm water. Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.

## For All Types of Anemia

Eat iron-rich foods. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets, carrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most anemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice and cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and carrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum effect.) Chlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using chlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.

Yogurt and turmeric. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an empty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is unbalanced, eat this at noon only.

Blue-green algae. Blue-green algae can also be effectively used, but primarily for pitta anemia. Because it is a rich source of prana, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will make them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.

Copper water. Vata and kapha individuals may find copper water effective. Fill a genuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the morning.

Diet and lifestyle choices. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet, exercise, and so on) for each doshic constitutional type. For vata problems, follow the anti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines; and for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.

### Correlation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia

Clinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classified by modern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by Ayurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis and hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-deficiency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to hypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated with iron deficiency and folic acid-deficiency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–kapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia categorized by modern medicine.

Yoga asanas. Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties.

## Anger and Hostility

Anger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is necessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of balance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and hostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.

### Remedies:

- Diet: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, especially avoiding hot, spicy, and fermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks, and avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.
- Keep Cool: Avoid saunas, steam baths, overheating from exercise or sports, and excessive sun exposure.
- Oil Massage: Rub bhringaraj oil or coconut oil on your scalp and soles of the feet to bring down excess pitta.
- Use Sandalwood Oil: Apply a drop of sandalwood essential oil on specific areas like the "third eye," throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists.
- Herbal Teas: Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea made with chamomile, tulsi (holy basil), and rose petal powder.

These remedies can help balance emotions and control anger and hostility.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on a holistic approach to health and well-being, emphasizing the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are lively and enthusiastic.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production. Balanced Pitta types are intelligent and focused.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha relates to the elements of earth and water. It regulates stability, strength, and immunity. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Angina

Angina, or angina pectoris, is a condition caused by Kapha dosha. It results in chest pain due to blocked prana vata in the coronary artery. Herbal remedies like shringa bhasma, musta, and arjuna can be effective in treating angina.

### Remedies for Anger

To pacify Pitta-related anger, you can try drinking a Pitta-pacifying drink, practicing breathing exercises like shitali pranayama, doing specific yoga poses, and meditating to calm the mind and emotions.

### Herbal Tea for Calming

A simple herbal tea recipe with chamomile and cilantro can help in calming the mind and reducing anger. Steep the herbs in hot water and drink it multiple times a day for best results.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Angina Remedies

Take ½ teaspoon of a specific mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water. Another effective remedy is to boil ½ cup each of milk and water, add ½ teaspoon of arjuna and 2 pinches of saffron, and take it twice or 3 times a day. This remedy can be beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.

In India, angina is often treated with powerful herbs taken sublingually for immediate relief. Consult your Ayurvedic physician for more information on these herbs. A healing paste of ginger powder and shringa bhasma can be applied topically to the chest for relief. Deer horn paste can also provide instantaneous relief when applied to the chest.

Time to See the Doctor: Any chest pain related to the heart should be taken seriously. Consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, especially if it occurs with less exertion than usual or lasts longer than a few minutes.

Gold water and specific yoga postures can also be beneficial in managing angina symptoms.

## Anxiety Remedies

Anxiety, often associated with insomnia and fear, is primarily due to vata dosha aggravation in the nervous system. Balancing vata is essential to heal anxiety. Here are some effective Ayurvedic remedies:

Calming Tea: Make a tea using specific herbs:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Anxiety

## Time to See the Doctor

Everyone experiences worry and anxiety from time to time. But if severe anxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with your social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are three reasons to see a doctor:

1. You chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.
2. You have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.
3. You avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.

This formula effectively pacifies vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this tea twice a day.

## Relaxing Bath

A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.

## Almond Milk

Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted) almonds overnight in water. Peel off the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add 1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg and saffron.

## Orange Juice

For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1 teaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.

## Calming Pressure Point

Make a fist with your left hand, so that the fingers rest in the middle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle finger ends, in the “heart” of the palm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press firmly on this point in the center of your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This will calm down the agitation of prana, which causes anxiety.

## Ayurvedic Oil Massage

Giving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas should use sesame oil; pittas, sunflower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7 ounces of warmed-up (not hot) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to toes. Ordinarily this massage is done before the morning bath, but if you have high anxiety or insomnia, you can also do it before going to bed.

A minimassage is also effective: Using the appropriate oil for your constitution,

Low appetite is a condition associated with low jatharagni (digestive fire) in Ayurveda. To improve appetite, fasting can be effective in kindling the digestive fire. Avoid continual munching and cold drinks, as they can depress agni.

If lack of appetite persists, try chewing fresh ginger with lime juice and rock salt to stimulate agni. Emotional factors can also contribute to low appetite, in which case a tea of ginger, brahmi, and chamomile can be helpful. Additionally, taking triphala in warm water before bed may aid digestion.

### Arthritis

Ayurveda recognizes three categories of arthritis based on the doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Proper diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Each type of arthritis requires a specific approach to address the underlying doshic imbalance.

# Types of Arthritis

# Types of Arthritis

If arthritis is due to vata, your joints will crack and pop. They become dry and are not swollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to the touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular tender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to aggravate the pain.

Pitta-type arthritis is characterized by inflammation; the joint becomes swollen and is painful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.

In kapha-type arthritis, the joint also becomes stiff and swollen, but it feels cold and clammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to relieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around, the pain diminishes.

## For All Types of Arthritis

Treatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for all cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.

Depending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta, or kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive fire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.

Vata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels through the system and lodges in the asthi dhatu (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving rise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.

So our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back to the colon, and then to eliminate it.

This is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish this, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking triphala at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all types. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use haritaki for vata-type arthritis, amalaki for pitta-type, and bibhitaki for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1 teaspoon with warm water in all cases).

## For Vata-Type Arthritis

Follow the vata-pacifying diet (chapter 8). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and avoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley and corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.

# Bad Breath - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Bad Breath

Bad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or mouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is weak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.

Stand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the tongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.

The primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric fire (agni), which in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several effective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.

## DIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES

- Monitor your diet. Avoid heavy meals, cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt.
- Chew 1 teaspoon of roasted fennel and cumin seeds after each meal.
- Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day.
- Chew one or two cardamom seeds after meals.
- Drink cumin-coriander-fennel tea as a digestive aid.

## OTHER REMEDIES

- Take care of your teeth and gums. Clean teeth after each meal with Ayurvedic toothpaste containing neem or an herbal formula. Use dental floss daily.
- Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and neem oil to the gums to prevent receding gums.

Yoga postures such as Yoga Mudra and the Lion pose can also be beneficial.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, yoga, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, Vata individuals are energetic, creative, and flexible.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is linked to the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Pitta individuals are intelligent, ambitious, and have strong digestion when in balance.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is connected to the elements of earth and water. It governs stability, structure, and lubrication. Balanced Kapha individuals are calm, nurturing, and have strong immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Bad Breath

Lotus posture with a Forward Bend and the pranayama known as shitali are good remedies for combating bad breath. Following these guidelines can help in saying goodbye to bad breath.

### Baldness

Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as metabolic disorders, diseases, fungal infections, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. According to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and dosha imbalance.

To reduce pitta and preserve hair health, consuming aloe vera juice or gel, oil massage with coconut oil, and scalp massages with brahmi or bhringaraj oil are recommended remedies. Additionally, a nourishing diet including dairy products, white radish, coconut, and cabbage can support healthy hair growth.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Hair

## Herbs for Your Hair

Eat a handful of white sesame seeds every morning. One handful of these small seeds contains about 1,200 mg of calcium and magnesium and is a good source of nourishment for your hair.

Certain herbs are useful for nourishing the hair. Try this beneficial formula:

- dashamoola 5 parts
- bhringaraj 4 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts

At bedtime, add ½ teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup of goat’s milk, heat to boiling, and drink. This will build up the bones and nourish the hair.

## Mineral Supplements

You may also be able to improve the condition of your hair by taking mineral supplements to be sure you have enough calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Take a supplement containing approximately the following daily dose of minerals:

- calcium 1,200 mg
- magnesium 600 mg
- zinc 60 mg

Take these supplements at bedtime.

## Massage

Stress, stiffness in the neck, and whiplash from a car accident can also contribute to hair loss. To soften the neck muscles, relieve pain, and reduce stress, massage your neck and shoulder muscles before showering.

## Neck Exercises

You can also do some simple neck exercises, such as turning your head to the left 3 times, to the right 3 times, lifting it up 3 times, moving it down toward your chest 3 times, and then rolling it gently in a circle 3 times in each direction.

## Antistress Tea

To help you deal with stress, make a tea of equal proportions of jatamamsi and brahmi. Steep 1 teaspoon of the mix in 1 cup of hot water, and drink 2 or 3 times a day.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga postures can help to relieve tension in your neck and indirectly aid in keeping hair healthy. Recommended postures include the Shoulder Stand, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Cow pose.

## Meditate for Relaxation

You will also find meditation an effective means for reducing stress and tension. Try sitting quietly and observing your breathing. Or try the Empty Bowl meditation.

# Bites and Stings

# Bites and Stings

Any bite or sting of an insect can trigger a local irritation of pitta under the skin. As long as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic reactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving generalized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings and bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to be watchful.

## CILANTRO

As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice. Place a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and strain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to the skin at the affected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and hives or rash created by the sting or bite.

## DRINK COCONUT WATER

One can drink ⅓ cup of coconut water (the “juice” inside the coconut) with about ⅛ teaspoon kama dudha added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times will help heal the reaction to the sting bite.

## COCONUT ASH

Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried coconut, and set fire to it. It will catch fire like wax. Let it burn for about ½ inch and then blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry black residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.

Why does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and for natural steroids.

## APPLY NEEM OIL OR NEEM PASTE

At the site of the bite, you can also apply neem oil or a neem paste. Neem is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a little neem powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Do not use pure neem extract; instead use an herbalized oil made by boiling neem leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally available in natural food stores or Indian groceries.

## A HEALING PASTE

You will also find a paste made from ½ teaspoon of sandalwood powder plus ½ teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with sufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.

## PREVENTION

Neem oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world. It contains a natural chemical compound that repels insects. Rub a little onto exposed skin before going outdoors.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Bladder Problems

## Retention of Urine in the Bladder

In this condition, the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be due to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or a stone in the urethra. The following remedies can help:

- Alternate hot and cold compresses in the bladder area to stimulate urine flow.
- Apply punarnava paste directly above the distended bladder for about half an hour.
- Use a mixture of punarnava guggulu and shilajit to help dilate strictures or relax the prostate gland.

## Cystitis

Cystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, you can try the following remedies:

- Drink coriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea.
- Make a tea using equal proportions of coriander, cumin, and fennel.
- Try a mixture of punarnava and gokshura for relief from cystitis.

## Musta

Take ½ teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.

## Bladder Atonia

This is a condition in which the bladder’s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the bladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough and inadvertently pass some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white sesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unrefined brown sugar, and chew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple remedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your condition is better.

For further discussion and suggestions, see “Urinary Incontinence” and “Prostate Problems.”

## Bleeding, External

Generally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself. The blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the vast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is excessive.

Some people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate and clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the blood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause, failure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an early sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes profuse bleeding under the skin.

From the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to a pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating and doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription, then, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take specifically hemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.

APPLY COLD. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or wrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.

APPLY PRESSURE. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are:

1. tying a tourniquet
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Stopping Bleeding with Ayurvedic Remedies

1. Applying pressure directly over the bleeding area.

2. If the bleeding is in an extremity, raising the arm or leg higher than the rest of the body.

ALOE: Another effective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed into a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe vera gel will also be effective.

ASTRINGENT HERBS: Other astringent herbs like lodhra, kushtha, and bilva are effective in stopping bleeding. They can be used alone or mixed in equal proportions into a paste for direct application. Internally, take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day for continuing bleeding problems.

COTTON ASH: For external bleeding, burning a small ball of sterilized cotton and applying the ash to the wound will stop bleeding instantaneously. Leave the ash on the wound to form a scab for complete healing.

DRINK COLD WATER: Sometimes, drinking cold water can help stop bleeding as the coolness constricts blood vessels.

For cases of internal bleeding like peptic ulcers, hematoma, or bleeding through the urethra, make an herbal compound using lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mix these herbs in equal amounts and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day to help stop the bleeding.

NOTE: Pitta people bruise more easily due to thin blood vessels.

See also Rectal Bleeding for more information on internal bleeding.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Internal Bleeding Remedies

For internal bleeding, individuals with pitta constitutions can use a mixture of lodhra, kushtha, and bilva in equal amounts. Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water until the condition improves.

Time to See the Doctor: If there is blood in the urine or stools, it could indicate serious conditions like kidney problems or cancer. Consult a physician for further evaluation.

## Turmeric Paste

To stop internal bleeding and reduce hematoma-like swelling, apply a paste made of 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum powder. Apply pressure on the affected area after applying the paste.

## Saffron Milk

Drinking a cup of warm milk with ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron can help in stopping internal bleeding.

## Juices

Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice can also aid in stopping internal bleeding.

## Boils

Boils, painful pus-filled inflammations, can be caused by various factors including chronic constipation, high pitta in the blood, or a toxic liver. Repeated boils may indicate diabetes.

### Neem Powder Paste

Apply a paste of neem powder or neem oil at the site of the boil to help alleviate the condition.

### Triphala Wash

Wash the affected area with triphala tea by boiling 1 teaspoon of triphala in 1 cup of water. Let it dry on the skin for relief.

### For Diabetes

If there is a family history of diabetes and you experience repeated boils, try a mixture of neem, turmeric, and kutki. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 2-3 times a day with warm water.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Boil Remedies

To help take care of the root cause of the boil, continue taking the remedy until the boil disappears.

For Chronic Constipation: If the boil is due to chronic constipation, do a basti (enema) using dashamoola tea. Boil 1 tablespoon of dashamoola herb in a pint of water for 5 minutes. Let the liquid cool, strain it, and use it for an enema.

In addition, take ½ teaspoon of amalaki or the herbal compound triphala at night. Steep the triphala in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink. This purgation will help to remove excess pitta from the hematopoietic system, which is the cause of the boil.

Cooling, Healing Paste: Apply a paste of red sandalwood and turmeric powder locally. Mix ½ teaspoon of each powder in warm water to make a paste.

Bring the Boil to a Head: Apply cooked onions as a poultice, or apply a paste of ginger powder and turmeric (½ teaspoon of each) directly to the boil to bring it to a head.

Liver Cleansers: A boil may develop into an abscess if it is due to an infection of the sebaceous glands. Using a liver cleansing formula like aloe vera gel or an Ayurvedic mixture can help improve the condition.

## Breastfeeding Problems

The Child Has No Appetite: If the child has no appetite despite the mother producing a lot of milk, try giving the baby fennel tea. Make a tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds in boiled water and give the baby 1 teaspoonful every 10 to 15 minutes.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Children

Childhood is the kapha stage of life, when the body is building. It is also the time when many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may stagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving fennel tea can help wash out the kapha and stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes gently.

## Remedies:

1. Make Ghrita Madhu: Mix a pinch of pippali in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½ teaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick to stimulate the appetite.
2. Monitor Your Diet: Check if your milk tastes good to the child. Excess pitta in your constitution or a hot and spicy diet may make your milk bitter, affecting the baby's appetite.
3. Empty Your Breasts: If your child has a diminished appetite, ensure to empty your breasts to avoid congestion of the mastic and lymphatic tissue.
4. If You Decide Not to Breastfeed: Empty the breasts whenever milk is present to avoid stagnant milk causing issues.

## Insufficient Milk:

If the child has a strong appetite but lactation is scanty, here are some suggestions to increase milk quality and quantity:

- Shatavari Kalpa: Roasted shatavari in ghee and natural brown sugar. Take one teaspoon of sweet, roasted shatavari in warm milk 2-3 times a day.
- Plain Shatavari: Mix shatavari and natural sugar with ghee. Take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with hot milk.
- Almond Milk: Soak 10 almonds overnight, blend with hot water or milk, add honey, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.

## Herbal Formula for Healthy Lactation

To maintain healthy lactation, use the following herbal formula:

- kutki 2 parts
- shilajit 2 parts
- shatavari 3 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with a spoonful of honey. You may use this formula throughout the breastfeeding period.

## Infected Nipple

During breastfeeding, ensure proper cleaning of the nipple to prevent fungal infections.

## Prevention

To prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and milk stagnation, gently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Avoid applying oil to the nipple to prevent any adverse effects on the baby.

## Sore Breasts

Sore breasts can be due to hormonal imbalance, lymphatic congestion, premenstrual syndrome, or emotional factors. Self-treatment suggestions include gentle massage with warm castor oil and herbal remedies for water retention.

## For a Constipated Baby

In India, if a nursing baby becomes constipated, the mother intentionally applies a few drops of castor oil to her nipple. When the baby sucks the milk, those few drops of castor oil are taken in along with the milk, relieving constipation gently.

Herbal remedy:

- Punarnava 1 part
- Shatavari 1 part
- Musta 1 part

Instructions: Use ½ teaspoon of this mix in 1 cup of hot water to make a tea. Drink the tea and massage the breasts for remarkable improvement. Drink the tea twice a day until the soreness goes away.

Another effective herbal remedy for sore breasts:

- Jatamamsi 2 parts
- Shatavari 3 parts
- Tagar 3 parts

Instructions: Mix the herbs in the above proportions, use ½ teaspoon in a cup of water to make a tea. Steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink. Use this tea twice a day until the soreness is gone.

NOTE: Avoid using an overly tight bra for long periods as it obstructs circulation and proper breathing of breast tissue. Opt for a cotton bra for better breathability.

## Brittle Nails

The nails of our fingers and toes are considered in Ayurveda to be a by-product of bone formation (asthi dhatu). Proper nutrition for building strong bones is essential for healthy nails. Insufficient intake of calcium and magnesium or malabsorption of these minerals can lead to rough, brittle, cracked nails with ridges and creases.

To strengthen bones and nails:

- Take over-the-counter supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
- Ensure a daily dose of approximately 1,200 mg of calcium.

For brittle nails, consider taking magnesium (600 mg) and zinc (60 mg) supplements at bedtime for best results. If nails remain brittle even with dietary supplements, it may indicate poor mineral absorption due to toxins in the colon. Regularly taking the herbal compound triphala can help cleanse the colon and improve mineral absorption.

## Strengthening Nails Naturally

In addition to supplements, eating white sesame seeds daily or consuming Ayurvedic herbs like ashwagandha or shatavari in hot milk can promote nail growth and strength. Aerobic exercises and yoga postures, such as the Sun Salutation, can improve circulation and mineral delivery to nail tissues.

## Addressing Bone Health

Since nails are connected to bone tissue (asthi dhatu), strengthening bones can also help improve nail health. Consider taking triphala guggulu tablets twice a day to strengthen nails. Brittle nails in menopausal women may indicate weakness in bone tissue, suggesting a need to investigate osteoporosis.

## Dealing with Burns

Contrary to popular belief, fatty substances like butter are not recommended for burns, as they can aggravate the pitta dosha associated with burns. Seek appropriate medical attention for burns to avoid complications.

## Time to See the Doctor

For severe burns or any other serious health concerns, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Burns

We are not discussing serious burns in this section but common household burns, such as from inadvertently touching an iron, a skillet, or a cigarette. For serious burns, particularly over a larger area of the body, a person needs hospitalization, plasma, and intensive care.

The most effective way to treat a burn is with cold. Immediate application of something cold, such as ice or cold water, is the best remedy. If you have no ice cubes, use a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer.

After applying cold, make a paste of sandalwood and turmeric powders (equal amounts) mixed not in water but in aloe vera gel. Use about 1 tablespoon aloe vera and ¼ teaspoon each of the sandalwood and turmeric. Mix them together, and apply the paste topically. This will be soothing and healing.

Or, after the ice, when the burning sensation stops, apply bitter ghee (tikta ghrita).

Cilantro is beneficial for burns. Make fresh cilantro juice by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about ⅓ cup of water. Strain. Take the juice internally (2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and put some of the pulp directly on the skin.

It is important not to apply a bandage to cover the burn. Keep it open to the air. If you apply a bandage, the body’s heat may affect the burn adversely. So apply the herbal paste or bitter ghee, and leave it alone. If you have to cover it to keep the medication from rubbing off, use some light gauze.

## Bursitis

Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, the little fluid sacs around the shoulder, knee, and other parts of the body. Bursitis is a pitta condition that is similar to arthritis. Effective treatment for it is similar to the treatment for pitta arthritis.

Taking kaishore guggulu (1 tablet 3 times a day) should help. This herbal remedy is available by mail from various sources of Ayurvedic herbs.

Application of sandalwood paste will be soothing. Make the paste by taking 1 teaspoon of sandalwood powder and adding sufficient water to form a paste. Rub it gently onto the painful area.

Nasya, or the application of warm ghee nose drops to the nostrils (5 drops in each nostril), will help to relieve the pain. Nasya opens up the flow of prana and helps the prana to flow freely through the connective tissue of the joint, which will alleviate pain.

Topically, try gently rubbing some sesame oil, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, mahanarayan oil, or neem oil into the swollen joint or other painful area.

## Understanding Bursitis

As with arthritis, the pathological process of bursitis begins with toxicity accumulated in the colon. These toxins get absorbed in the bloodstream, go into the general circulation, and lodge in the bursae, leading to the symptoms of bursitis. It is important to keep the colon clean by using the following strategies:

- Before going to bed at night, take 1 cup of hot milk with 2 teaspoons of castor oil added. The laxative effect will eliminate pitta-type toxicity in the colon.
- If 2 teaspoons do not work, use 3 teaspoons the following night, adjusting your own dose. You should get a couple of good bowel movements in the morning, which will help to cleanse the impurities of the colon.
- As a second choice, you can take triphala or amalaki (1 teaspoon) at night in 1 cup of warm water.

### Diet Recommendations

Your diet should be pitta-soothing but not vata-provoking. Strictly avoid hot, spicy foods and fermented foods such as pickles. Also avoid raw vegetables and salad. Strictly avoid ice water and other ice-cold drinks. Don’t eat beans (pinto beans, adzuki beans, black beans, or garbanzos).

### Exercise Suggestions

As long as you have bursitis, you should not do strenuous exercise. Gentle yoga stretching is beneficial. Try the Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Cat poses, the Spinal Twist, and Forward Bend—under the guidance of a yoga teacher.

## Canker Sores

Canker sores are generally traumatic, that is, they are due to a cut or bruise in the mouth. When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips, crackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt the oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker sore.

People who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while brushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some individuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or even while chewing or talking.

### Topical Remedies

The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and honey. Mix together 1 teaspoon honey with ¼ teaspoon turmeric, and rub it on the sore.

## Overview of Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - within the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Characteristics of Doshas

- Vata: Associated with air and space, governs movement and is linked to creativity and vitality.
- Pitta: Associated with fire and water, governs digestion and metabolism, linked to intelligence and understanding.
- Kapha: Associated with earth and water, governs structure and stability, linked to calmness and nurturing.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Canker Sores

For canker sores, you can try the following remedies:

- Rinse your mouth with aloe vera juice multiple times a day.
- Apply aloe vera gel directly to the sore several times a day.
- Mix aloe vera gel with neem powder and apply to the sore.
- Use a tea tree oil solution as an antiseptic mouthwash.
- Try kama dudha herb mixed with fresh cream and apply to the sore.

Internal remedies include following a pitta-soothing diet, drinking cranberry juice, and consuming a mixture of rock candy powder and cumin powder. Addressing digestive issues with arrowroot and warm milk or ghee may also help.

### Cataracts

Cataracts, a kapha disorder, can be addressed with an herbal eyewash using triphala tea. This eyewash can help dissolve the molecules of kapha causing the cataract.

To prepare the eyewash, boil triphala in water, let it cool, strain it, and wash your eyes with the triphala solution using an eye cup.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body.
- Pitta: Governed by the elements of fire and water, Pitta controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.
- Kapha: Governed by the elements of earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Cataracts

To prevent cataracts, you can wash your eyes with triphala tea in the morning and at bedtime. Additionally, using one drop of pure castor oil in the eye at bedtime can help lubricate the cornea and prevent cataract formation. Taking a herbal mixture internally, consisting of punarnava, shatavari, and brahmi, can also be beneficial as a preventative measure against cataracts.

### Cellulite

Cellulite is not a disease but a condition related to subcutaneous fat accumulation. To address cellulite, focus on kindling the meda agni (metabolism of fat) through regular exercise, especially aerobic activities. Watch your diet to avoid kapha-increasing foods and consider using vitamin K cream topically to help reduce cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Minimizing Cellulite

Localized Massage: Massage the affected area with a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. After the massage, dust with a powder of the herb vacha (calamus) and rub the skin to help remove cellulite.

# Ayurvedic Approach to High Cholesterol

High cholesterol is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased lipids (fats) in the blood. Individuals with low liver function, diminished thyroid activity, history of steroid use, or a kaphagenic diet are more prone to developing high cholesterol.

Your cholesterol level should ideally be below 200. Levels above 200 can lead to plaque formation on artery walls, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.

There are two types of cholesterol: HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol). The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is considered more important than the total cholesterol level in predicting health problems.

## Tips to Reduce High Cholesterol:

- Watch Your Diet: Follow a kapha-pacifying diet, avoid fatty fried foods, cheese, high-fat dairy, minimize sweets and cold foods, and include garlic and onion in your cooking.
- Get Regular Exercise: Walk for at least half an hour daily, engage in aerobic exercises like swimming at least three times a week.

## Ayurvedic Remedies for High Cholesterol:

- Garlic: Consume a mixture of fresh garlic, grated ginger root, and lime juice before each meal.
- Cinnamon and Trikatu Tea: Prepare a tea with cinnamon, trikatu herbal mixture, honey, and drink it twice a day.
- Trikatu with Honey: Taking trikatu with honey multiple times a day helps in burning ama, reducing excess kapha, and regulating cholesterol.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Cholesterol

## Herbal Mixture for High Cholesterol:

This herbal mixture can help control high cholesterol levels:

- kutki 3 parts
- chitrak 3 parts
- shilajit ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon twice a day, with honey and hot water.

## Triphala Guggulu Tablet:

Take one 200-mg. tablet of triphala guggulu 3 times a day.

## Chitrak-Adhivati Tablet:

Another herb that has been remarkably effective in bringing down cholesterol levels is chitrak-adhivati. Taking 1 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will help bring cholesterol back to normal.

## Hot Water and Honey:

Early in the morning, drink 1 cup of hot water into which you add 1 teaspoon of honey. This will help to “scrape” fat from your system and reduce cholesterol. Adding 1 teaspoon of lime juice or 10 drops of apple cider vinegar will make the drink more effective.

## Foods that Reduce Cholesterol:

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain foods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa, millet, and oatmeal. Some research suggests that apples, grapefruit, and almonds can also help reduce cholesterol.

## Yoga Postures:

Yoga postures that are good for controlling cholesterol include the Sun Salutation, Shoulder Stand, Peacock, Cobra, Spinal Twist, Locust, and Lotus.

## Breathing Exercise:

The breathing exercise known as Breath of Fire (bhastrika) is also helpful. (See chapter 6 for instructions.)

## Colds and Flu:

Individuals often get colds and flu during the winter and spring seasons. The symptoms are all too familiar: runny nose, cough, congestion, headache, an achy body, and sometimes fever.

Ayurvedically speaking, colds are a kapha-vata disorder. The body builds up an excess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and at the same time it may suffer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric fire), leading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.

# Ginger Remedies

# Ginger Remedies

The best remedy for colds is ginger. Here are several simple home remedies using ginger that will greatly relieve your cold symptoms and hasten full recovery.

## Herbal Tea Recipe

Combine the following herbs together:

- ginger 1 part
- cinnamon 1 part
- lemongrass 2 parts

Steep 1 teaspoon of this formula for about 10 minutes in 1 cup of hot water; strain it, and add honey for sweetness if you like. If you drink this delicious tea several times a day, it will help to take care of cold, congestion, and flu.

## Ginger-Cardamom-Cinnamon Tea

Another excellent remedy is ginger-cardamom-cinnamon tea. Here is the formula:

- ginger 2 parts
- cinnamon 3 parts
- cardamom just a pinch

Steep 1 teaspoon in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. When the tea has cooled down somewhat, you can add about ½ to 1 teaspoon of honey for taste.

## Steam Inhalation

Boil 1 teaspoon ginger, or a few eucalyptus leaves, in a pint of water. Turn off the stove, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This will relieve congestion and help you feel much better. Just steam alone, with no herbs added at all, will also be beneficial.

## Additional Herbal Remedies

- Try ½ teaspoon fennel seed powder mixed with 1 teaspoon natural sugar, 2 or 3 times a day.
- For a cold with cough and congestion, mix ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey. Eat this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.
- For flu, make a tea from 1 teaspoon tulsi (holy basil) in 1 cup water. Boil for just 1 minute and then drink.

An ancient Ayurvedic herbal formula that is effective for colds is the following:

- sitopaladi 1 part
- maha sudarshan churna 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Herbal Remedies for Colds

Combine these herbs in equal proportions and take ¼ teaspoon with 1 teaspoon honey 2 or 3 times a day after eating.

Western herbology has some helpful herbs for colds. Try this mixture:

- Echinacea 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Cinnamon 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with honey twice a day.

CAUTION: Don’t Combine Ginger and Aspirin. Ginger and aspirin are both blood thinners and should not be taken together. Therefore, it is wise to drink ginger tea—or use any other ginger remedy—either two hours before or two hours after you take any aspirin.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

- Vitamin C: Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.
- Natural Nose Drops: Put some liquefied ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning and evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and sneezing of a cold.
- Hot Water: Drinking hot water several times a day is an effective way to remove toxins from the system and hasten recovery from a cold.
- No Dairy Products: Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk, and all cold drinks.
- Rest: Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax.
- Only Mild Exercise: Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous exercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do some gentle yoga asanas. Surya namaskar (Sun Salutation) is beneficial. The inverted postures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as well as Forward Bend, help to prevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus through the nose.
- Breathing Exercise: Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold. Inhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times. This exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract. For more detailed instructions, see chapter 6.
- Another Effective Breathing Exercise: Deep Alternate Nostril breathing, without...

## Prevention of Common Cold

As a preventive measure, take the herb amalaki. It is a rasayana (rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of amalaki daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold. If you are already taking triphala at night, which includes amalaki, avoid taking extra amalaki to prevent diarrhea.

## Colitis

Colitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon, leading to inflammation. The basic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.

### Herbal Remedies for Colitis

- An excellent herbal remedy for colitis includes shatavari, shanka bhasma, kama dudha, and sanjivani. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or 2 months.
- You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day, as it is cooling and helps reduce pitta.

## Enemas for Ulcerative Colitis

For ulcerative colitis characterized by diarrhea, mucus, and blood from the rectum, Ayurveda suggests a healing enema using a tea made from an astringent herb such as bilva, ashoka, sandalwood, or licorice root. Follow the instructions below to prepare the enema:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herb (e.g., licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.
2. Strain and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm.
3. Let the liquid cool to room temperature and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5 minutes if possible. Repeat this procedure once or twice a week.

(More detailed instructions for basti can be found in appendix 3.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Governs movement and is associated with qualities like dry, light, and cold.
- Pitta: Governs digestion and metabolism and is associated with qualities like hot, sharp, and oily.
- Kapha: Governs structure and stability and is associated with qualities like heavy, slow, and steady.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Remedies

Licorice contains food precursors of natural steroids, which can help heal ulcers. Consuming cooked apples with ghee and nutmeg can pacify the irritation of colitis. Apple juice can also relieve the burning sensation.

#### Soothing Oil Enema

To combat excess pitta and pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests using a cooling oil like coconut oil in the rectum as an enema.

#### Dietary Precautions

Avoid hot spicy food, alcohol, and tobacco as they can aggravate pitta and irritate the colon in ulcerative colitis.

#### Exercises to Strengthen the Colon

Leg lifts and specific yoga postures like Chest-Knee pose and Plow pose can help strengthen the colon wall in cases of ulcerative colitis.

### Conjunctivitis Remedies

Conjunctivitis is a pitta condition involving inflammation of the eyes. Effective remedies include soothing the eyes with cooling substances and avoiding exposure to bright light.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Conjunctivitis

## Cilantro Leaves

Apply the pulp of fresh cilantro leaves on closed eyelids. Blend a handful of cilantro leaves with ¼ to ⅓ cup water; strain out the juice, and apply the pulp to your closed eyelids. Drinking the liquid will also be beneficial.

## Coriander Eyewash

Make an eyewash by steeping 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds in 1 cup boiling water for at least 15 minutes. Strain thoroughly, and cool before using the water on your closed eyes. (Don’t worry if a little goes into the eyes.) Careful: Don’t use it either too hot or too cold.

## Goat's Milk Compress

Dip a sterilized cotton ball in goat’s milk, and put it over your eyes. This will cool down pitta and allow conjunctivitis to be healed.

## Herbal Remedy

Internally, you can take a mixture of equal parts of kama dudha and gulwel sattva. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture with warm water twice a day for 1 week.

## Healing Conjunctivitis in Children

The best way to heal conjunctivitis in young children is to place a drop of mother’s milk in the eye. Mother’s milk is healing for her child. If the mother is still lactating, and her child gets conjunctivitis, with irritation and discharge in the eye, just one drop of her milk may heal it.

## Natural Herbal Antibiotics

Make a turmeric solution by stirring some turmeric into a few ounces of pure water. Immerse a clean handkerchief into the solution, and let it dry. Then use it to mop the affected eyes.

If your conjunctivitis is not cleared up within 3 to 4 days, immediately see your doctor. The natural antiseptic, antibiotic properties of the turmeric will help take care of the bacteria and facilitate healing.

Herbal antibiotics are also helpful taken internally. You can make a mixture of turmeric, neem, and manjistha. Take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water, after meals.

# Constipation

Constipation is a vata condition expressing such vata qualities as dryness and hardness. It is caused by insufficient fiber in the diet, insufficient water intake, lack of exercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create distension and discomfort, flatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead to absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping vata in balance.

## Prevention and Remedies

Follow the Vata-Pacifying Diet: One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if you have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet. Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans; favor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is helpful.

Triphala: Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is triphala, a combination of three herbs beneficial for all doshic types. Most problems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala at night. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.

Some people find that taking triphala at night creates a diuretic action and they have to get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the triphala in a cup of warm water overnight and drink it first thing in the morning. The best time to take triphala is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 A.M.

### Further Recommendations

- Snack on Fruit: Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. Eat some fruit between meals. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow bananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation.
- An Apple a Day: Apples are effective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To combat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.
- Pineapple Juice: Another effective remedy for constipation.

## Raisins

A handful of raisins every day, at least an hour after meals.

## Prunes

## Peaches

One or two peaches about an hour after meals.

## Eat More Fiber

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help keep the bowels regular. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are also high in fiber.

## Milk and Ghee

Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at bedtime is an effective and gentle means of relieving constipation, especially for vata and pitta constitutions.

## Castor Oil

Castor oil can be used for obstinate constipation. A remedy is to make ginger tea, add 2 teaspoons of castor oil, and drink it before bedtime. Adjust the dose as needed.

Suggestion: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends when you can stay home.

## Flaxseed

Boil 1 tablespoon of flaxseed in a cup of water at night for at least 2 to 3 minutes. Drink the whole cupful, including the tea and seeds.

## For Constipation in Children

Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.

## For Severe Constipation

If there is absolute constipation for three days, avoid purgatives. Instead, do an enema with warm water or herbal tea like triphala or dashamoola.

## Prevention

Here are several suggestions for avoiding constipation in the future.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Cough

Another helpful natural remedy for a productive cough is the following:

Ingredients:

- Bay leaf: 1/2 teaspoon
- Pippali: 1/4 teaspoon

Instructions: Take this mixture with 1 teaspoon of honey 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also try 1 teaspoon honey mixed with a pinch of clove powder, 2 or 3 times a day.

## Other Coughs

Productive Cough with Greenish-Yellowish Mucus: In such a cough, there is some secondary infection due to the involvement of pitta dosha. For this condition, you can use a tea made of equal proportions of sitopaladi and maha sudarshan. Use 1/4 teaspoon of the mixture to make a tea and drink it 3 times a day with honey.

Time to See the Doctor: If your cough persists for more than a week, you should see a doctor. It will encourage elimination of the mucus and help heal the cough quickly.

For a Child's Cough: Try giving the child a drink of 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with a pinch of ginger powder and a pinch of pippali powder.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sitopaladi with 1 teaspoon of honey as an effective cough remedy for children. However, if the mother is sensitive or allergic to pollen, the child may be allergic to honey. In that case, instead of honey, use maple syrup.

For a Chronic Cough: Make a mixture of 4 parts garlic powder to 1 part trikatu. Add a little honey. Take this twice a day.

## Diarrhea

Generally, diarrhea occurs when agni (the digestive fire) becomes weak. As a result, absorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstuff gets eliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen agni and to pacify whatever dosha—generally pitta—is aggravated.

Indigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also create diarrhea.

### Pacify Pitta

The first line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet. Follow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet, especially keeping away from spicy and fermented foods.

### Time to See the Doctor

If there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control. However, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if these home remedies don’t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.

### Four Food Cures

- Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will also help stop diarrhea right away.
- If you don’t have apples, you can use bananas. Chop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, add 1 teaspoon of warm ghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to bind the stool.
- Another effective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a cupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain fresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.
- Blend together equal parts of yogurt and water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Herbal Remedies

Try ginger powder (about ½ teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar. Mix together, and chew the mixture with some warm water. Take 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

Another simple remedy is the following:

- ghee 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg ¼ teaspoon
- ginger powder ¼ teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon

Mix together and eat. Like the ginger-sugar mixture above, take this formula 2 or 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days.

For acute diarrhea, mix ½ teaspoon fennel powder with ½ teaspoon ginger powder, and chew this mixture 2 or 3 times a day.

Try drinking a cup of hot black coffee with a little lime juice (about 10 drops) and a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg.

If your diarrhea appears to be the result of high pitta, use this herbal formula:

- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- arrowroot ½ teaspoon

Mix together, and take with ½ cup warm water 2 or 3 times a day.

You can also use sat isabgol (psyllium husks) to combat pitta diarrhea. This may sound strange, as psyllium is often used as a laxative. However, in pitta diarrhea, an excess of pitta accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and irritates the wall of the colon, creating the diarrhea. So at bedtime, take 1 teaspoon sat isabgol mixed into a cup of fresh yogurt. That will absorb pitta and bind the stool, helping to correct the diarrhea. Be sure the yogurt is freshly made, not old.

## Avoid Dehydration

Diarrhea can sometimes cause dehydration. To prevent this from happening, add 1 teaspoon of natural sugar, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, and a pinch of salt to a pint of room-temperature water, and sip throughout the day.

NOTE: If the diarrhea continues beyond three days, it would be wise to consult a doctor.

# Diarrhea in Babies - Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Diarrhea in Babies

Diarrhea in the babies of nursing mothers may be due to the mother’s diet. For example, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then her milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests that when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a pitta-pacifying diet.

## An Apple A Day

A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child some cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to room temperature.

Suggestion: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle. With a clean scissors, cut off the tip of the nipple, making an opening large enough for the applesauce to flow through.

## Make Whey

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often due to altered flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal flora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.

Bring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice (about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk will curdle. Then strain the thick part out by pouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.

The remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the child every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.

(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called paneer, much used in Indian cooking. Try it!)

## A Simple Herbal Remedy

Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½ teaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.

## Poppyseed Porridge

You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup milk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will swell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food that helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.

## Time to See the Doctor

If your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements are becoming less frequent and are firmer and denser, your child is getting better. But if the stools continue to be watery and occur several times in a day, and if your baby’s eyes appear sunken, the lips are dry, and she or he looks drowsy, these are all warning signs of dehydration. This is a serious condition, and you need to consult a doctor.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dry Skin

Dry skin can have several causes. It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily) secretions; insufficient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata. External causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use of soap or dishwashing soap.

Moisturizing Cream May Not Be the Answer: Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract dry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external causes. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the problem.

In general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of the sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin looks soft and oily. But then the glands become tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater success if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by lubrication of the colon with oil enemas.

## Effective Ayurvedic Home Remedies:

Apply Some Oil: In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to eliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you are pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.

However, application of oil to the skin will probably not be sufficient. To treat the internal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.

### Oil Enema Procedure:

- Step 1: Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give yourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before proceeding to step 2.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Oil Enema for Skin Health

For the oil enema, use 1 cup of sesame, sunflower, or corn oil based on your vata-pitta-kapha recommendations. Inject the oil into the rectum and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. This enema helps make the skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous by lubricating it from within.

For best results, follow this schedule:

- Week 1: Every day
- Week 2: Every 2 days
- Week 3: Every 3 days
- Week 4: Once

## Cherry Mask for Beautiful Complexion

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face at night for 15 minutes before rinsing off. This simple remedy can give you a beautiful complexion.

## Earache Relief

If you experience earache due to excess vata, rule out infections or excess wax first. To treat vata-related earache:

Tea Tree Oil: Apply diluted tea tree oil to the painful ear to heal external ear infections.

Tea Tree Oil with Neem: Combine neem oil with tea tree oil for an effective treatment. Apply a few drops of the oil mixture to the ear passage.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Antibiotic Herbs

At the same time you are treating the infection on the outside with tea tree oil, internally you can take turmeric-echinacea-goldenseal tea:

- Turmeric 1 part
- Goldenseal 1 part
- Echinacea 1 part

Stir ½ teaspoon of this mixture into hot water, steep for a few minutes, and drink. Alternatively, simply swallow ½ teaspoon of the powder mixed in 1 teaspoon of honey. Take 3 times a day after food, for 1 week. This powerful antiseptic, antibiotic formula will help control the ear infection.

# Asafetida

You can also take a small amount of cotton, put a pinch of asafetida into it, and roll it into a capsule-like shape. Place that ball of cotton into the outer ear. The fumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.

# Onion Juice

Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey. Mix well; introduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or a little warmer before you put it in your ear.

# Heat

Earache can also be moderated by heat. Take a handkerchief and put it on a warm (not hot) pan, fold it, and place it on the ear to give a little soothing external heat.

## Earwax

Earwax is one of the natural secretions of the body. It has the function of protecting the eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is constantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry black or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct hearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.

### Wash It Out

Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of it. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of warm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that water to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which essentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water has to be free to come out again), and squirt the water gently into the ear. You will want to tilt your head toward the shoulder of the ear you are cleaning and hold your head.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Earwax Removal

When dealing with stubborn earwax, there are several Ayurvedic remedies that can help:

## 1. Irrigation with Warm Water:

Use a bulb syringe to gently irrigate the ear with warm water over a basin or sink. Finish with a rinse of plain warm water.

## 2. Soften with Oil:

Before irrigation, soften the wax by lubricating the ear canal with warm garlic oil. Apply warm garlic-infused sesame oil a few times a day for a day or two.

## 3. Dissolve with Hydrogen Peroxide:

Use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to dissolve the wax. Oxygenate the ear by putting a few drops in the ear, then clean with warm sesame oil.

## 4. Massage to Loosen:

Massage the outside of the ear with sesame or castor oil to loosen stubborn wax. Pull the ear lobe and open your mouth to aid in wax removal.

## 5. Herbal Remedy:

Take triphala guggulu tablets twice a day for one month to address excessive earwax production caused by increased vata in the muscle tissue.

## 6. Prevention:

Sleep on your left side once a month with warm sesame oil in your right ear to prevent earwax buildup. The oil will help the wax rise to the surface for easy removal.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies, you can effectively manage and prevent earwax issues.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eating Disorders

# Kinds of Eating Disorders

Bulimia and Binge Eating: Almost everyone does some extra munching now and then. But if you often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge eating disorder or bulimia. Individuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining weight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don’t induce vomiting. Binge eating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.

Overeating: Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and emotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate for those emotions, people go on eating.

Anorexia: Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who have a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia is often depression.

## Suggested Remedies

Here are some brief suggestions to help you deal effectively with these eating disorders. For more complete treatments, please see “Overeating” and “Obesity.”

- Follow a low-fat diet: Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice cream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.
- Eat hot spicy food: When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, curry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama that causes overeating.
- Eat two or three meals a day: That’s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-meal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music; choose a gentle, loving raga. Don’t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will overstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.
- Licorice: Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic that acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.
- Herbal Tea: To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea. Excellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, brahmi, or jatamamsi. These are good individually, but a tea made from all of these mixed together in equal amounts is especially effective to reduce stress and balance the emotions. Use ½ to 1 teaspoon of.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Eye Irritation

Around the age of 40, alochaka pitta (a subtype of pitta associated with vision) tends to become low, and people frequently find that their eyes become irritated. This irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (resulting from excess vata) or related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. High or stagnant pitta in the liver may also be a causal factor.

It is important to identify the cause in order to treat it effectively. Here are some remedies that can help in relieving eye irritation:

1. Take a Break: Rest your eyes if you are using them extensively, such as in front of a computer or while driving. Take a break every hour or two.
2. Use a Protective Screen: Reduce radiation and glare by using a protective screen on your electronic devices.
3. Change Your Focus: Give your eyes a break from close-up work by refocusing on a distant object. Close the book and look at something far away every half hour.
4. Take a Tea Break: Relax and relieve eye strain by taking a short tea break. Chamomile, comfrey, mint, or chai tea can be soothing.
5. Rose Water Eye Drops: Prepare a solution of rose water by mixing 1 ounce of distilled or purified water with 5 drops of pure rose water. Rinse your eyes with this solution using a dropper or eye cup.
6. Splash Your Eyes with Water: Wash your eyes with clean water by splashing it gently. This can help in relieving eye irritation.

Additionally, consider Ayurvedic remedies like vidanga, neem, and shardunika to support eye health. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day after lunch and dinner.

Remember, these remedies can be beneficial in various situations, but it's essential to address the root cause of eye irritation for long-term relief.

## Simple and Best Remedy for Irritated Eyes

Put a single drop of pure, genuine castor oil (without preservatives) into your eyes at bedtime. Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles of your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil from staining your sheets.

## Bloodshot Eyes Remedy

If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange juice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.

### Fainting and Dizziness

Additional information on fainting and dizziness remedies can be found in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Increased vata dosha, along with excess pitta moving in the nervous system, cause fainting and dizziness. There are two types of dizziness:

In the first kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am still, but the room is moving around me.” That is called objective dizziness, and it is primarily due to aggravated vata.

The second type is called subjective dizziness. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or disequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily by excess pitta. The difference between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint, especially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish between the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.

## Time to See the Doctor

The remedies in this section are simple, effective means of relieving dizziness. But if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a neurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to some serious pathology.

Vertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in the inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a condition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo. Ménière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these conditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for dizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.

Dizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insufficient oxygen in the room.

If you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving, focus on a fixed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by focusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the rajasic quality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.

The kind of dizziness known as motion sickness is often associated with nausea and vomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule filled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring some candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and you feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a fixed point, such as the horizon or a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.

Sometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible causes for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some antihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you find yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up slowly. This will help.

Pitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Dizziness

Even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective dizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious. Drinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.

## Quick Remedy for Fainting

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle some cold water on the face.

## Dizziness from Exercising

Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated from sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple as it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta as well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.

## Deep Breathing

Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in ujjayi pranayama (see chapter 6) and holding the breath behind the belly button.

## Ear Pull

Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index finger into your ear and gently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial pressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.

## Natural Smelling Salts

For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and inhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia; inhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and dizziness is automatically corrected.

## Herbal Formulas

If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a wonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:
- brahmi 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- saraswati ¼ part

Take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.

The following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:
- shatavari 1 part
- jatamamsi 1 part
- kama dudha 2 pinches

If you take ½ teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm water, it will help take care of your dizziness.

## Sandalwood

Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or incense.

## Ghee Nose Drops

Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until it is liquefied. When cool enough not to injure delicate tissue, put 3 to 5 drops in each nostril.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue

Fatigue is physical and mental stress. It can be caused by various factors such as low gastric fire, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, anemia, or conditions like Epstein-Barr virus. Here are some treatment recommendations:

## Fatigue After Exercise or Hard Physical Work

To combat fatigue after exercise or hard physical work:

- Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch of rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice can help pacify pitta.
- Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or ashwagandha tea once or twice a day can be beneficial.

## Anemia-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to anemia, consider the following remedies:

- Treat anemia with blood builders such as pomegranate juice, grapes, grape juice, beets, beet/carrot juice, or the herbs abrak bhasma and loha bhasma.

## Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Fatigue

If fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, address it as a pitta disorder:

- Follow a pitta-pacifying diet.
- Use the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, bala, vidari, and kama dudha. Take this mixture with shatavari ghee to strengthen the liver and help remedy chronic fatigue.

It's important to identify the root cause of fatigue to determine the most effective treatment approach.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

The three doshas in Ayurveda are Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

Syndrome: To strengthen gastric fire, you can use ginger before meals, avoid cold drinks, and consider taking chitrak-adivati tablets. If fatigue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious illness, and consulting a physician is recommended.

Yoga Postures and Pranayama: Alternate Nostril Breathing and gentle yoga stretching can help kindle the gastric fire. Exercise is not recommended for cases of fatigue unless due to idleness.

To Build Strength and Energy: Food remedies like dates soaked in ghee with ginger, cardamom, and saffron can provide added nourishment and strength.

## Fever

Fever is a sign of ama (toxins) moving in the circulatory system. It is not often a sign of infection. In most cases, fever is due to toxicity in the rasa dhatu, the body's basic vital tissue. When the ama is eliminated, the fever will subside.

### Don't Eat

For fever, the first treatment recommended by Ayurveda is to observe a fast. A total fast is recommended for acute fever if the person is strong enough. If the person is weak, it is better to drink water, fruit juice, or herbal teas like holy basil or lemongrass. Avoid drinking milk as it can worsen the fever and cause diarrhea.

### Herbal Remedies

The simplest herbal remedy for fever is cilantro juice. Take 2 teaspoons of cilantro juice 3 times a day to help lower the fever. You can also make an herbal tea with lemongrass, tulsi, and fennel to induce sweating and bring down the temperature.

#### Time to See the Doctor

Fever is a sign that your body is fighting toxins or infection and is healing itself. It is usually self-limiting and will disappear on its own.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever

When the needed healing is done. But there are definitely times when fever requires the attention of a medical professional:

- Any fever in a baby under 4 months old
- Fever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit in an adult
- Fever above 101 degrees in a person over age 60
- Fever that lasts longer than 3 days
- Fever accompanied by a severe headache and a stiff neck
- Any fever in a person who has a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease

If any of these conditions are present, call a doctor or seek immediate attention.

## Herbal Remedies for Fever

1. Tea made of:

- Coriander (2 parts)
- Cinnamon (2 parts)
- Ginger (1 part)

Steep 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. You can drink this every few hours until the fever breaks.

2. Three-ingredient tea made of household herbs:

- Cumin seeds
- Coriander seeds
- Fennel seeds

Mix seeds in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of your mixture in a cup of boiling water; steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Grape Juice with Herbs: Grapes are cooling. Into a cup of grape juice add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon fennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder, and drink. This will help to relieve fever.

Avoid Cold Drinks: When you have a fever, it’s best not to drink anything cold. Use the lemongrass-tulsi-fennel tea mentioned above, or any of the other herbal suggestions. Any hot tea will help to kindle the body’s digestive fire (agni) and burn the ama (toxins). Again, fever is a sign of ama in the system; once the ama is burned out, the body’s temperature will come back to normal.

## Fever Remedies

If the temperature is high, prepare a bowl of cool water into which you have added 1 teaspoon of salt. Fold two pieces of clean cloth (such as handkerchiefs), dip them into the water, and put one on the forehead and one over the belly button. Repeat as needed. This will bring down the temperature quickly.

If you can get maha sudarshan churna from an Ayurvedic pharmacy, take ½ teaspoon twice a day with warm water. This formula will bring down any kind of fever.

If the person with high fever has a pitta constitution, there may be a danger of febrile convulsions. To help relieve this condition, make a slight modification of the procedure described above. Grate an onion and wrap half in one of the damp handkerchiefs, the other half in the second handkerchief. Place on the forehead and belly button, as above.

The belly is the seat of pitta, and the onion will help absorb the pitta. Tears will come to the eyes, the convulsions will stop, and the temperature will come down. If this procedure doesn’t bring the fever down, see a doctor.

STAY PUT. It is not a good idea to exercise or to travel when you have a fever. If you do get a fever when on a journey, follow any of the above recommendations that you can; if possible, take maha sudarshan churna (½ teaspoon with a little warm water).

FOR CHRONIC FEVER. Make a tea of 1 teaspoon holy basil (tulsi) steeped in 1 cup hot water. Add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon honey. Take this 2 or 3 times a day.

Another excellent formula to bring down chronic fever is ½ teaspoon maha sudarshan churna mixed with 1 teaspoon tikta ghrita (bitter ghee). Take this 3 times a day on an empty stomach.

## Fibrocystic Breast Disease

According to Ayurvedic principles, fibrocystic breast disease is a kapha disorder. Excess kapha builds up, leading to congestion, enlargement of the breasts, tenderness, and development of fibrocystic tissue.

GENTLE MASSAGE. To help reduce the accumulation of kapha, apply 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil to the breasts, and gently massage from inside to outside, that is, from the breastbone toward the armpits. Do this gentle massage before taking a warm shower. Or you can do a soap massage of the breasts during your shower, again massaging from the center of your chest outward.

Massaging the breasts in this way will improve the circulation of the mastic tissue and encourage lymphatic drainage into the armpits; in this way, fibrocystic changes can be alleviated.

## Preventing Fibrocystic Breasts

To help prevent fibrocystic breasts, you can use the following effective herbal remedy:

- kutki 2 parts
- chitrak 2 parts
- punarnava 5 parts

This herbal combination (½ teaspoon twice a day) can prevent the accumulation of kapha in the breast that leads to the development of fibrocystic tissue.

Kapha-Reducing Diet: As fibrocystic breasts are due to excess kapha, it is helpful to follow a kapha-reducing diet. Avoid dairy products, cold food and drink, heavy meats, wheat, and most sweets except honey.

Yoga Postures: Daily yoga postures like Locust, Bow, Boat, Spinal Twist, and Shoulder Stand can be beneficial for fibrocystic breasts.

## Dealing with Food Allergies

To effectively deal with food allergies and minimize their impact, start by identifying the foods you are allergic to based on Ayurvedic principles.

### Determining Your Food Allergy Type

The type of food allergy you have can be determined by your dosha:

- Kapha-Type Individuals: Allergic to kapha foods like dairy products, wheat, cucumber, and watermelon. Symptoms may include heaviness in the stomach, slow digestion, congestion, cough, or water retention. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-type asthma.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Individuals with excess Vata may experience allergies to raw foods, beans, and certain animal proteins. Symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, insomnia, and muscle issues.

Pitta: Those with high Pitta may show allergic reactions to hot, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and fermented foods. Symptoms include heartburn, acid indigestion, nausea, and hot flashes.

Kapha: Kapha individuals may have their own set of food allergies based on their constitution and current doshic status.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Food allergies should be studied based on an individual's prakruti (constitution) and vikruti (current doshic status). Treatment involves avoiding problematic foods and following a diet suitable for your body type.

### Treatment Recommendations

Vata-Type Food Allergies: Consider a dashamoola basti (enema) twice a week to pacify Vata and minimize allergies. Drinking licorice tea can also be helpful.

Pitta Food Allergies: Control Pitta food allergies with virechana chikitsa (purgation) using herbs like amalaki or psyllium husks to address pitta stagnation in the small intestine.

For more detailed remedies and information, refer to the complete book on Ayurvedic home remedies.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Food Allergies

## For Pitta Food Allergies:

Therapy clears away the pitta so that the allergy can be brought under control. Continue with virechana daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.

It is also helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples, cook them for a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1 teaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after meals.

## For Kapha Food Allergies:

The Ayurvedic purification known as vamana (vomiting) will be helpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2 pints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then try to vomit it out. This purification process will remove excess mucus from the stomach and help clear up food allergies.

If vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry; the remaining salty water won’t hurt you and will have a beneficial cleansing effect.

Kaphas should also fast on Sunday and make a tea out of licorice root powder, cinnamon, and coriander to sip throughout the day.

## For All Food Allergies:

If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha, try this simple remedy that is effective for all types: Roast cumin, fennel, and white sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.

To prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, dry-roast them separately, then mix with rock salt. Chewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help prevent food allergies.

# Frequent Urination

# Frequent Urination

See “Bladder Problems,” “Prostate Problems,” and “Urinary Incontinence”

## Frequent Urination During Pregnancy

Frequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the uterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure on the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got sufficient space to accumulate urine and expand, so just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.

If frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her rest. Ayurveda suggests this simple home remedy: Eat a handful of white sesame seeds with about ½ teaspoon of jaggery or natural brown sugar. This mixture will pacify vata dosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In this way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.

Additional suggestions:

- Don’t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.
- Don’t drink anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or cola, especially in the evening. Caffeine is a diuretic (it promotes urination) and is exactly what you don’t need if you want to counteract frequent urination.

For further recommendations, see “Urinary Incontinence.”

# Gallstones

# Gallstones

Gallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow metabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile becomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.

## Alleviating the Pain

In general, gallstones are not painful. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the gallbladder through the bile duct. To reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing.

Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of your abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are not recommended.)

## Herbal Formula for Acute Attack

During an acute gallstone attack, use the following herbal formula:

- Musta: 4 parts
- Trikatu: 3 parts
- Guduchi: 6 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce the pain and ease the gallbladder attack.

## Liver Flush to Eliminate the Gallstone

When the pain is gone, you can do a liver flush to wash out the gallstone. This liver flush should not be done if the stone is large. It is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and consult with your physician before proceeding.

Combine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and...

### Important Note

This liver-flushing treatment should not be done without the approval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an Ayurvedic physician to avoid damaging the gallbladder and experiencing dangerous complications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gallstones

To treat gallstones, mix 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Drink this mixture in the early morning on an empty stomach. Avoid eating until at least noon and drink hot water or lime juice if thirsty. This treatment shocks the gallbladder, causing it to contract and squeeze out the gallstones into the duodenum.

Take 1/2 teaspoon of triphala with warm water at night. The next day, you may pass green stool containing gallstone crystals. To prevent gallstones, improve thyroid function and metabolism with a mixture of punarnava, shatavari, kutki, chitrak, musta, and shilajit taken regularly for 2 to 3 months.

Practice yoga postures like Bow pose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose to help empty the gallbladder and improve circulation, preventing gallstone formation. Avoid deep-fried foods, dairy products, and fatty foods to prevent bile coagulation.

## Gas and Flatulence

Gas and flatulence are common issues caused by vata dosha imbalance in the colon. Factors like vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, and swallowing air contribute to gas buildup. To reduce gas, avoid vata-aggravating foods and practice relaxation techniques to balance vata dosha.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Flatulence Remedies

Flatulence is caused by fermentation in the colon, leading to the production of gases that result in discomfort. Here are some effective remedies:

1. Ginger Remedy: Grate fresh ginger root, mix with lime juice, and consume after meals.
2. Lemon Juice Remedy: Mix lemon juice and baking soda in water, drink after meals to aid digestion.
3. Cumin-Fennel-Celery Seed Mixture: Chew on a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and ajwan seeds after meals.
4. Charcoal Tablets: Swallow charcoal tablets after lunch and dinner to absorb gases.
5. Herbal Tablets: Consider shankavati and lasunadivati tablets for stomach discomfort and flatulence.

Dietary Guidelines: Follow a vata-pacifying diet, avoid raw/cold foods, beans, and fermented foods to prevent flatulence.

Triphala: Steep triphala in hot water before bed to aid in digestion.

## Glaucoma

Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure due to kapha dosha accumulation in the eyeball. It can lead to serious complications like blindness. Factors like heavy lifting, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking can contribute to glaucoma.

Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential to manage glaucoma effectively.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Glaucoma Remedies

If upon examination by an eye doctor it is determined that you have higher than normal intraocular pressure, these remedies may be helpful.

### Herbal Remedy

In earlier stages of glaucoma, Ayurveda treats this problem with the following formula, which will help to relieve the tension in the eye:

- punarnava 5 parts
- jatamamsi 3 parts
- shanka pushpi 3 parts

Boil 1 teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of water for a few minutes to make a tea. Drink twice a day.

### Triphala Tea Eyewash

To relieve the tension in the eye, wash the eyeball with triphala tea, which helps to regulate pressure in the eye. Boil ½ teaspoon triphala in 1 cup water for 2 minutes, strain it thoroughly, cool it down, and wash the eye.

### Treat the Source of the Problem

In addition to herbal remedies, one has to determine and treat the root cause of the glaucoma. If the problem is related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or high cholesterol, specific instructions are provided.

### Reduce Kapha

Follow a kapha-pacifying diet and avoid certain foods like coffee, white sugar, and dairy products.

### Exercise Caution

Avoid heavy weightlifting and strenuous activities. Be mindful of yoga poses, especially inverted poses like Headstand and Shoulder Stand.

## Gum Disease

Gum disease includes receding gums, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and swollen gums. Ayurveda attributes these conditions to imbalances in vata and pitta doshas.

### General Care

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lodhra, kushtha, and bilva. Mixing these herbs in powdered form can create an excellent cleanser for brushing teeth. Rinsing the mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## For Receding Gums:

Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, making them sensitive to cold and prone to infection. To help with this issue, swish warm sesame oil in your mouth for 3 minutes before bed. Massage your gums with your index finger and leave the oil residue in your mouth.

## For Bleeding Gums and Gingivitis:

Triphala tea is effective for gingivitis and bleeding gums due to its astringent qualities. Gargling with triphala tea can help stop bleeding and improve gum health. Other remedies include orange juice with natural sugar, lemon water, raw apples, pears, melon, and raspberries.

## For Infected Gums:

Tea tree oil and clove oil are beneficial for infected gums, reducing pain and promoting healing. Apply one drop of oil directly to the affected area. Dental floss treated with tea tree oil can help with infected pockets below the gumline.

## Hair Care Secrets:

In Ayurveda, hair is considered a by-product of bone formation. Proper nutrition for bones is essential for healthy hair growth. Lack of calcium and magnesium absorption can lead to brittle hair, split ends, and breakage.
---
# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

# Ayurvedic Secrets for Healthy Hair

It is important to note that unhealthy hair may indicate poor absorption of minerals, affecting bone health. The health of hair and nails can reflect bone health.

## Proper Diet

Healthy hair depends on a nutritious diet. Dairy products, white radish, daikon, coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are beneficial for hair and bones.

## Mineral Supplement

Taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals can improve hair condition and bone strength. A recommended daily dose includes:

- Calcium: 1,200 mg
- Magnesium: 600 mg
- Zinc: 60 mg

## Oil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty

Rubbing oils like Amla oil, bhringaraj oil, and brahmi oil on the scalp promotes healthy hair growth and maintains natural luster. Massage the scalp before bed to improve circulation and nourish the roots.

Instructions:

1. Pour oil into a small dish and warm it up slightly.
2. Dip fingertips into the oil and massage the scalp gently from the crown down towards the ears.
3. Avoid rough or rapid application to prevent disturbing the hair roots.

## Sesame Seeds

Consuming a handful of white sesame seeds every morning provides calcium, magnesium, and promotes healthy hair growth.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Coconut Water for Calcium

Drinking coconut water (the “juice” inside the fresh coconut) also helps to provide essential calcium for hair growth. You can have ½ cup a day. Drinking coconut milk (made from coconut “meat” blended in water) is also helpful, but is a second choice.

NOTE: If you have high cholesterol, you may not want to use so much coconut, as coconut is high in saturated fat, which increases cholesterol in the blood.

## Stimulate Your Hair by Combing

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the opposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root of the hair and will make your hair healthier. Vigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.

## Yoga for Your Hair

Several yoga postures are effective for relieving pressure and tension in the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp. These include the Shoulder Stand; the Camel, Cobra, and Cow poses; and the Spinal Twist.

NOTE: For strategies to combat hair loss, see “Baldness.”

## Hangover

The effects of overconsumption of alcohol—headache, dullness, inability to focus the mind clearly, nausea, dizziness, and so on—are all symptoms of excess pitta. Drinking too much alcohol may become toxic to the stomach and liver, which triggers pitta and can eventually lead to serious illness.

The following recommendations will help you get over the effects of drinking too much alcohol the night before and will help restore normal functioning:

- Drink a glass of water with about 1 teaspoon lime juice, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt added. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda. This will immediately take care of pitta aggravation, and you will feel much better.
- A glass of fresh orange juice with 1 teaspoon lime juice and a pinch of cumin powder can help with both alcohol and drug-induced hangover.
- If you are feeling drowsy and dull, with an aching head, a burning stomach and no appetite, try a cup of cool lassi. Blend 1 tablespoon of fresh yogurt with 1 cup of water and a pinch of cumin powder. Drink this 3 or 4 times in the day. It will be effective to prevent dehydration, relieve nausea, and soothe the burning in your stomach.
- You can also use this herbal formula:
- shatavari 5 parts
- shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- kama dudha ⅛ part

- Vata type: Occipital area or left side headaches due to vata imbalance.
- Pitta type: Temple area headaches due to excess pitta and acidic conditions.
- Kapha type: Frontal and nasal area headaches due to kapha imbalance.

Other causes of headaches in Ayurveda include ear problems, eye problems, food allergies, and poor sleeping positions.

Treatment in Ayurveda is specific to the individual's dosha imbalance and the root cause of the headache.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ayurveda Overview

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characteristics include dry, light, cold, rough, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and constipation.
- Pitta: Characteristics include hot, sharp, intense, and light. Imbalance can manifest as anger and inflammation.
- Kapha: Characteristics include heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in lethargy and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

Hearing Loss: To improve hearing, Ayurvedic remedies include Yogaraj guggulu capsules, avoiding vatagenic foods, using garlic oil in the ear, practicing specific yoga postures like Lion and Camel, and seeking medical advice if no improvement is seen.

## Heart - Ayurvedic Care

The heart is considered a vital organ in Ayurveda, associated with prana, ojas, and mind. Maintaining heart health involves controlling factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and stress.

For high blood pressure and cholesterol, dietary adjustments are crucial. Avoiding certain foods can help control cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Exercise

To keep your heart healthy, daily exercise is essential. The type and intensity of exercise should be based on your age, fitness level, and dosha type. Kaphas require the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, and pittas fall in between. Walking at least two miles a day is beneficial for most individuals. Additionally, engaging in aerobic activities like fast walking, gentle jogging, or trampoline exercises can further improve heart health.

## Cholesterol-Reducing Foods

Include cholesterol-reducing foods in your diet if you have high cholesterol levels. Some of these foods include oatmeal, corn, apples, fresh fruit juice (orange or grapefruit), millet, and various fresh vegetables. Consuming these foods daily can help lower cholesterol levels.

## Stress Management

To manage stress effectively, consider incorporating quiet meditation and daily practice of Savasana into your routine. Meditation is a powerful tool to relax, reduce stress, and promote healing. Spending 10 to 20 minutes meditating twice a day can have a positive impact on heart health. Savasana, the yogic rest pose, involves lying flat on your back, focusing on your breath, and finding moments of stillness between inhalation and exhalation. This practice promotes tranquility and healing for the heart.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

# Other Remedies

In addition to diet, exercise, and stress management, there are several simple home remedies that can help keep your heart healthy:

## Gold Water

Gold is healing for the heart, good for the coronary artery, and can help reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, refer to appendix 1.

## Herbs for Your Heart

- Arjuna: Take ½ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm water. Arjuna acts as a coronary vasodilator, protects the heart, strengthens circulation, and maintains heart muscle health.
- Ginger: Make fresh ginger tea by boiling grated or sliced ginger in water. Eating ginger daily can help prevent heart attacks.
- Ayurvedic Herb Formula: Mix punarnava, kutki, gulwel sattva, and shilajit. Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in hot water to make a heart-healthy tea.
- Garlic: Including garlic in your diet can reduce cholesterol, strengthen circulation, and act as a decongestant.

## Rudraksha

Rudraksha seeds are good for the heart physically and spiritually. They are believed to be beneficial for meditation and opening the heart chakra. You can wear a necklace of the beads or soak a bead in water overnight and drink the water in the morning to reduce blood pressure and strengthen the heart.

## Yoga Postures

Ayurveda recommends daily yoga postures for heart health unless there are acute heart problems.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Heart Health

Ancient Ayurvedic wisdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. Charaka, an ancient sage-physician, provided valuable advice for heart care:

One should avoid causes of mental stress and instability to protect the heart and vital essence. Regularly adopting measures to support the heart, cleanse blood vessels, increase knowledge, and calm the mind is essential. Practices such as nonviolence, conservation of vital energy, and acquisition of knowledge are beneficial. Control of sensory organs, celibacy, and knowledge of reality are also emphasized for overall well-being.

It is important to note that if you have any heart problems or are over 40, consulting a physician before starting a new exercise program is recommended. For those with heart issues, alternative postures such as Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra poses, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg can be substituted for the Sun Salutation.

Additionally, incorporating deep breathing exercises like ujjayi pranayama can be beneficial for heart health.

## Heartburn and Acid Stomach Remedies

While there are strong medications available for heartburn and acid stomach, Ayurveda offers natural remedies that can help alleviate these conditions:

1. Drink a glass of cold milk to soothe heartburn.

2. Chew a few basil leaves or fennel seeds after meals to aid digestion.

3. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it for relief from acid stomach.

4. Sip on ginger tea or chew on a piece of ginger to reduce acidity.

5. Avoid spicy and oily foods that can trigger heartburn and acid reflux.

By incorporating these Ayurvedic home remedies into your routine, you can effectively manage heartburn and acid stomach issues naturally.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Herpes

## Herpes Labialis

Herpes labialis comes through the oral contact of kissing, or drinking from the same cup or glass. It is essentially a pitta disorder that comes from rakta dhatu (blood) and breaks out on the skin, particularly in the corner of the mouth or on the upper lip.

Many people confuse herpes and canker sores, which are somewhat similar in appearance. With canker sores, however, only one ulcer appears; herpes produces a rash consisting of numerous small blisters, possibly clustered around one central, larger bump. Also, canker sores are usually in the mouth, while herpes sores are on the outside.

- Externally, one can apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) directly onto the affected area. Aloe vera gel or ointment is also quite effective.
- You can also use ¼ teaspoon kama dudha, mixed into 1 teaspoon dairy cream. Apply to the sore in the morning and at bedtime.
- Internally, use an Ayurvedic herbal mixture of neem, kama dudha, and maha sudarshan. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day, either with tikta ghrita or with warm water.
- At night, take ½ teaspoon triphala in warm water. This will pacify systemic pitta and help relieve the herpes.

## Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is similar to oral herpes but is transmitted differently; oral herpes through kissing or drinking glasses, and genital herpes through sexual contact.

- For internal treatment, use the same herbs and herbal formulas recommended for oral herpes.
- Externally, tikta ghrita can also be helpful. Apply some tikta ghrita to the glans penis and/or labia minora before intercourse to prevent aggravation.

## To Neutralize Stress

One of the primary causes of herpes eruptions appears to be psychological stress. To minimize stress:

- Take herbal tea made of chamomile, jatamamsi, and brahmi to help reduce stress levels.

## Chapter: Hiccups

Hiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a result, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.

### Remedies:

- Hold Your Breath: The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep breath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.
- Brown Bag Remedy: Breathe into a paper bag to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of the diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes.
- Honey and Castor Oil: Mix 1 teaspoon honey with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Dip your index finger into the mixture and then lick your finger every 2 or 3 minutes.
- Deep Breathing Exercise: Practice Alternate Nostril pranayama for 5 minutes.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of mind, body, and spirit to promote overall health and well-being.

## Doshas and Their Characteristics

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, pitta with fire and water, and kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and influences various aspects of our health.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Hiccups

Serious hiccups may require medical attention if they persist for more than two days. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by constipation, bloating, and gases in the colon. In such cases, performing basti (enema) using warm sesame oil can help relax the diaphragm and internal muscles.

If hiccups continue, a warm water enema can be done as well.

### Hypertension

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health risks such as heart disease and stroke. Ayurveda categorizes hypertension under vata, pitta, and kapha doshas.

Vata is associated with constriction of blood vessels, pitta with increased blood force, and kapha with increased blood viscosity. Stress and emotions like anger and anxiety can also contribute to high blood pressure.

It is important to manage hypertension through lifestyle changes, diet, and stress reduction techniques.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

If blood pressure stays high, it can become dangerous.

## Time to See the Doctor

If high blood pressure is temporary and related to a stressful situation, some rest and relaxation will generally take care of it. Even in the long term, just because pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with medications. Natural means such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation, and yoga, which have no negative side effects, may be sufficient to deal with hypertension.

However, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision. Hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is recommended to use Ayurvedic remedies as an adjunct to medical care, with the doctor's knowledge and approval, and to monitor progress closely.

## Foods for Hypertension

- Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a pinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (Note: If your cholesterol level is high, skip the ghee.)
- Mix orange juice and coconut water in a ratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.
- Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed peach juice. Drink this 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood pressure.
- Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and coriander added. This will act as a mild diuretic and help regulate blood pressure.
- Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a yogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking.
- Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is good for persons with hypertension.
- Honey water can also help. Add a teaspoon of honey and 5 to 10 drops of apple cider vinegar to a cup of hot water, and drink it in the early morning.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for High Blood Pressure

One effective Ayurvedic remedy for regulating blood pressure is a tea made from the following herbs:

- Jatamamsi - 2 parts
- Musta - 2 parts
- Tagar - 1 part

Steep ½ teaspoon of the herb mixture in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drink the tea after lunch and dinner.

## Other Remedies and Recommendations

Keep Cool: Avoid working hard under the hot sun if you have high blood pressure to prevent promoting hemorrhage in the brain.

Magnetic Water: Drink magnetic water by placing a cup of water next to the north pole of a magnet for 2 hours. Drink a cupful of magnetic water twice a day to help control blood pressure.

Rudraksha: Soak 1 or 2 rudraksha beads in a cup of water overnight and drink the water the next day to regulate blood pressure.

## Deep Relaxation to Help High Blood Pressure

Tension and stress can increase high blood pressure. Try the yogic rest pose, savasana, for deep relaxation:

Lie flat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the flow of your breath and practice quiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes. This natural antidote for hypertension can help you relax.

Meditation: Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure and can be as effective as medications in controlling hypertension without negative side effects.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Breathing Exercise

Some gentle shitali pranayama can help control blood pressure. Make a tube of your tongue, and inhale through that tube into the abdomen. Hold the breath for a few seconds and then breathe it out through your nose.

## Yoga Postures

Effective yoga asanas for helping control hypertension include Yoga Mudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in appendix 4.)

## Exercise and Work with Care

No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the Headstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician’s guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Hypertension may lead to serious complications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe, and effective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and care of your physician.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at your regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or experience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental confusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a person can even have convulsions and fall into a coma.

The brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the necessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive sufficient blood sugar, it goes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the other symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.

According to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta prakruti (a pitta constitution) or pitta vikruti (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates the secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat and tremors.

An unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to hypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.

Hypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood sugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—and also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel hypoglycemic symptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main meals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Ayurvedic Remedies

Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-aged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that he or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health concern and requires medical attention.

## Types of Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia can be classified into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting hypoglycemia results from not eating regularly, while reactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas secretes too much insulin in response to a large intake of sugar.

## Ayurvedic Recommendations

To deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha by following a pitta-pacifying diet and avoiding hot spicy foods, fermented food, sour fruits, and alcoholic drinks.

### Licorice Tea

Drink licorice tea when experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms. Use 1 teaspoon of licorice root per cup of water to safely increase blood sugar levels.

### Herbal Remedies

- Combine brahmi, jatamamsi, shanka pushpi, and licorice to make a tea that nourishes the brain and helps it function on limited sugar.
- For postprandial hypoglycemia due to gastrojejunostomy, Ayurveda suggests a mixture of guduchi, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to be taken twice a day.
- Consider using shilajit, a nervine tonic that rejuvenates the pancreas, if there is a suspicion of a pancreatic tumor.

## Preventing Adult-Onset Diabetes

Ingredients:

- Shilajit - 1 part
- Shardunika - 1 part

Instructions: Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture after lunch and dinner with some water.

### Yoga Postures

Some yoga asanas to strengthen the pancreas and help prevent hypoglycemia include the Peacock, Camel, and Locust poses, and the Elevated Lotus, as well as nauli (an abdominal exercise explained in appendix 3). Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia should do these yoga exercises and Alternate Nostril breathing.

### Nasya

Brahmi ghee nasya, 5 drops in each nostril, will quickly relieve nausea, sweating, and mental confusion (see appendix 3).

### For Drowsiness

Drowsiness can be corrected by taking some sweet juice, such as pomegranate or sweet orange juice.

## Impotence Remedies

Impotence, which is a man’s inability to have or to maintain an erection, may have several causes. It can be due to emotional, psychological issues, stress, or certain physical problems.

Massage to Improve Circulation: Massage the pubic area and the root of the penis with a few drops of mahanarayan oil to improve circulation and potentially eliminate the problem.

Apply Herbalized Oil: Apply bala oil or ashwagandha oil directly to the penis.

Massage the Prostate Area: Massaging above the prostate gland with the mentioned oils or plain ghee can be beneficial for improving circulation.

## Strengthening Herbal Formula

For internal use, make a mixture of equal proportions of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day in warm milk, continuing for 3 months. Add chopped fresh garlic to the warm milk to improve blood supply and vessel dilation.

## Mild Aphrodisiac Drink

Every night, drink a cup of warm milk with a pinch of saffron added. Saffron is an aphrodisiac and increases sperm count.

## Relax with Tranquillity Tea

## Yoga Postures

Practice yoga poses like Rooster pose, Elevated Lotus, Vajrasana, Chakra Asana, and Bow pose to help with impotence. Refer to illustrations in appendix 4.

## Indigestion

The effectiveness of digestion depends on the strength of your digestive fire (agni). Avoid heavy, liquid, or dense food intake that can inhibit agni. Emotional eating and wrong food combining can also lead to indigestion.

For more information, refer to the chapter on "Urinary Incontinence" in the book.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

The digestive fire, when imbalanced, can lead to indigestion. Factors such as incompatible food combinations, excess secretion of acid, fermentation of food in the stomach or intestines can result in symptoms like acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and stomachache.

To address indigestion, it is important to avoid causative factors and utilize herbal treatments. Here are four ways to increase your digestive fire:

## Four Ways to Increase Your Digestive Fire

- Ginger: Kindles agni. Chew fresh ginger with lime juice and salt before meals.
- Garlic and Trikatu: Mix garlic powder, trikatu, and rock salt before lunch and dinner.
- Herbal Mix: Combine fresh garlic, cumin powder, rock salt, trikatu, and lime juice before meals.
- Bay Leaf: Steep bay leaf in hot water with cardamom and drink after eating.

## Fasting

Fasting can help dispel indigestion by kindling the digestive fire and giving the digestive system a rest. You can observe a complete fast or try drinking sweet fresh pineapple juice with ginger, black pepper, and organic sugar three times a day.

## When You Have Indigestion

When experiencing indigestion, consider the remedies mentioned above to alleviate symptoms and improve digestion.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Indigestion

## To relieve a case of indigestion:

ONION JUICE: Take ¼ cup of fresh onion juice with ½ teaspoon honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

GARLIC: Chop up a clove of fresh garlic, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and eat it.

LIME JUICE: For acute indigestion, squeeze the juice from ¼ lime in 1 cup warm water. Just before drinking, add ½ teaspoon baking soda, and then drink it down quickly.

## For Chronic Indigestion:

For people with chronic poor digestion (weak agni), prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

Take ¼ teaspoon of this effective formula before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. This mixture will strengthen the digestive fire.

## Ten Tips to Prevent Indigestion:

- Don’t eat unless you are really hungry.
- Don’t eat emotionally. Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.
- Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid snacking between meals.
- Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive fire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.
- Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid, leaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.
- Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major role in digestion.
- You can finish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4 teaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.
- Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose. (See illustrations in appendix 4.)

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Kidney Issues

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Kidney Issues

## Congestion, High Pitta, or Crystal Urea in the Kidney

Congestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all create tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests the following simple remedies:

### Herbal Mixture

Prepare a mixture of the following herbs:

- Punarnava - 1 part
- Gokshura - 1 part
- Fennel seed - 1 part

Take 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it down with warm water.

### Cumin-Coriander-Fennel Tea

Prepare a tea by mixing equal amounts of cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds. Boil in water and drink 2 or 3 times a day. (Use about ¼ teaspoon of each herb per cup of water.)

### Ayurvedic Herb Drink

Combine about ½ teaspoon of musta with ½ teaspoon of fennel. Steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and drink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.

## Kidney Stones

There are different types of kidney stones corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha dosha:

- Calcium stones (kapha stones)
- Phosphate stones
- Oxalate stones (pitta stones)

### Herbal Remedies

If you already have a kidney stone, Ayurveda suggests Punarnava Guggulu and Gokshuradi Guggulu. Take one tablet of each twice a day after lunch and dinner.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Kidney Stone Remedies

If you have begun to pass a kidney stone and are experiencing significant pain, you can try the following herbal formulas:

### Herbal Formula 1

- Punarnava 1 part
- Mutral 1 part
- Coriander 1 part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer. Beer acts as a diuretic and, in combination with the herbs, helps in the passing and decrystallization of the kidney stone, making the process easier and less painful.

### Herbal Formula 2

- Punarnava 5 parts
- Gokshura 3 parts
- Mutral 2 parts
- Shilajit ⅛ part

Taking ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with a can of beer can also aid in passing the kidney stone with reduced discomfort.

If you prefer not to consume beer, you can opt for nonalcoholic beer, barley tea, or barley soup as alternatives, as they all have diuretic properties.

### Hot and Cold Applications

Another method to alleviate the pain of passing a kidney stone is by applying hot and cold packs alternately to the kidney area. Use a hot water bottle or compress along with an ice bag or frozen vegetables, alternating every 30 seconds to 1 minute until the pain subsides.

### Watermelon Juice

Drinking a cup of watermelon juice with ¼ teaspoon of coriander powder can help flush the kidneys and aid in the removal of small stones and crystals due to the diuretic properties of watermelon and coriander. This mixture can be consumed 2 to 3 times a day.

## Low Libido

Libido, the desire for pleasure and satisfaction, is linked to shukra dhatu (male reproductive tissue) and artava dhatu (female reproductive tissue) in Ayurveda. Low libido may result from weakness or debility in these tissues.

Low libido is a common symptom experienced by many individuals in middle age or even earlier.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Low Libido

In addition to weakness in the reproductive tissue, emotional factors and high stress are the primary causes of a reduced sex drive. It can be effectively treated with Ayurvedic programs and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.

Low libido can be a problem that affects one's marriage or partnership. On the other hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body, shutting off excess loss of the health-giving vital fluid. From this perspective, low libido may be seen as an expression of the body’s intelligence.

Intentional celibacy is quite different from low libido. In celibacy, there is incredible sexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it into supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.

In cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. Below are some Ayurvedic remedies to increase libido:

## For Men:

- Gently press the glans penis with the top of your index finger at a specific marma point to increase libido.
- Massage the glans penis with bala oil or shatavari ghee.
- Internally, take 1 teaspoon of ashwagandha and ½ teaspoon of vidari with warm milk at night.

## For Women:

- Mix 1 teaspoon of shatavari with ½ teaspoon of vidari and take it with warm milk at night.
- Massage the pubic bone with bala oil, shatavari ghee, castor oil, or brahmi ghee.

## Food Remedies for Both Men and Women:

Include aphrodisiac foods like almonds, saffron, and ghee in your diet to naturally boost libido.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Almonds

Eat 10 raw (unroasted) almonds for breakfast. Soak them overnight in water, and the next morning peel off the skins before eating.

Make this strengthening almond drink: As above, soak 10 raw almonds in water overnight, and peel off the skins the next morning. Then put the almonds in a blender, and add:

- warm milk 1 cup
- ghee 1 teaspoon
- natural sugar 1 teaspoon
- nutmeg a pinch
- saffron a pinch

Blend thoroughly. It is yummy, and excellent for combating low libido!

## Dates

Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add:

- ginger 1 teaspoon
- cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch

Cover, and keep in a warm place for at least 2 weeks. Then eat 1 date daily in the early morning. These dates taste delicious and help to remedy low libido and sexual debility as well as chronic fatigue.

## Apple Dessert

Another delicious and strengthening concoction is the following apple dessert. Remove the skins and core from 5 raw apples. Blend or mash them to make a pulp, and mix thoroughly, adding some honey according to your taste. Then add:

- powdered cardamom ⅛ teaspoon
- saffron 1 pinch
- nutmeg 1 pinch
- rose water 10 drops

Enjoy ½ cup of this dessert at least an hour after meals.

NOTE: Avoid milk, yogurt, and fish for at least 4 hours before and after eating this apple dessert.

## Figs and Honey

After breakfast, eat 3 figs with 1 teaspoon honey. An hour later, take a glass of lassi. This will help restore sexual energy.

## Garlic and Onions

Adding some more garlic and onions to the diet is helpful. However, these foods are not considered good for meditation as they are somewhat dulling to the mind, so if that is a concern of yours, you can skip this and the following two.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Recommendations

- Garlic milk is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Mix together 1 cup milk, ¼ cup water, and 1 clove chopped garlic. Boil gently until only 1 cup of liquid remains, and drink at bedtime.
- Take 1 tablespoon onion juice mixed with 1 teaspoon fresh ginger juice twice a day.

## Other Remedies for Men and Women

Herbal Remedy: Low libido can be effectively treated with this herbal formula:
- Shatavari 1 part
- Vidari 1 part
- Nutmeg ⅛ part
- Tagar ½ part

Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning and another teaspoon in the evening, with warm milk. Continue taking it twice a day for 1 month.

Low Libido and Constipation: These two conditions are often found together. To easily overcome constipation, take triphala daily, ½ teaspoon at night with warm water. Brew the triphala powder in about a cup of hot water, let it steep for 10 minutes, strain, and drink.

For Psychological and Emotional Issues: If stress and psychological problems such as anxiety or hostility are contributing to your state of low libido, it will be helpful to meditate regularly, practice yoga asanas, and do breathing exercises. Particularly helpful asanas include Vajra, Rooster, Camel, and Nataraj. (Guidelines for yoga postures are found in appendix 4.)

## Memory Problems

Everyone has occasional episodes of forgetfulness. Forgetting a name, date, or other information that seems to be on the tip of the tongue can make a person frustrated. One may forget where one has parked the car or left one’s keys. Such experiences are common to everyone. On the other extreme, a severe form of forgetfulness happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which one may fail to recognize one’s wife, husband, children, friends, or family members.

Memory problems are often the result of an inadequate supply of nutrients to the brain. Also, as age advances, memory frequently becomes poorer. Alcohol destroys brain cells, so memory loss among alcoholics is quite common. Memory problems may also be due to the use of drugs such as LSD, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as to alcohol abuse.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Principles for Memory Improvement

All these can damage the brain tissue and memory will be affected. According to Ayurvedic principles, memory is recorded on the sensitive film of the nerve cells within the brain, which are of a kapha nature; memory is enlivened and brought back at a proper time by means of vata. Most memory problems are due either to stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy qualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta, on the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.

## Memory Foods

Carrots: Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance pitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink carrot or beet juice, both of which are blood builders and will help improve memory.

Kitchari Fast: Kitchari is a simple, nourishing dish made essentially of 50 percent basmati rice and 50 percent split yellow mung dal, with some spices usually added for flavor. A five-day kitchari fast, using plain kitchari with just some chopped cilantro leaves added, will cleanse the system and help to strengthen memory.

### Simple Kitchari Recipe

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup yellow split mung dal
- 1 small handful cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 cups water

Wash the rice and mung dal twice, using plenty of water. If you have time, let the mung dal soak for a few hours before cooking, to help with digestibility. Add rice, dal, and cilantro to the water. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Fruit Fast: A 3- to 5-day fruit fast, with triphala at night (½ teaspoon steeped for 5 to 10 minutes in a cup of hot water), will sharpen the nervous system and make the brain more alert.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Memory Improvement

## Fruit Fast for Memory Enhancement

A fruit fast can be beneficial for memory improvement as it helps in detoxifying the body and enhancing mental clarity. However, it should be avoided by individuals prone to hypoglycemia. Recommended fruits for the fast based on doshas:

- For Vata: Papayas, prunes, mangoes
- For Pitta: Grapes, pomegranates, apples
- For Kapha: Apples, cranberries, pomegranates

## Other Foods for Memory Improvement

In addition to fruits, certain foods can help in improving memory. Foods like sweet potatoes, tapioca, okra, and spinach are beneficial. Sattvic foods, including fresh fruits, vegetables, almonds, oranges, ghee, and milk, are good for memory enhancement. Avoid heavy meats if you have memory issues.

## Herbs for Memory Enhancement

Several herbs are known for their memory-enhancing properties:

- Ginkgo and Gotu Kola: These herbs improve memory by increasing circulation to the brain.
- Medhya Herbs: Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Bhringaraj, and Shanka Pushpi are specific herbs that improve memory. You can make a tea by steeping these herbs in hot water and drink it twice a day for a month.
- Brahmi Milk: Boil Brahmi in milk and drink it at bedtime for remarkable memory improvement. Add saffron for additional benefits.

Consistent use of these herbs and practices can help in enhancing memory and cognitive function over time.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

Vata: Governed by the elements of air and space, Vata is responsible for movement and communication in the body. Imbalance can lead to issues like anxiety and memory problems.

Pitta: Associated with the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta imbalance may manifest as inflammation and irritability.

Kapha: Comprised of earth and water elements, Kapha provides structure and stability. Imbalance can result in lethargy and congestion.

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

# Strategy to Prevent Menstrual Problems

Perhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to prevent menstrual problems. You can follow this strategy quite easily, effectively, safely, and inexpensively.

ALOE VERA GEL: For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual pain and discomfort.

DIETARY GUIDELINES: Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

If you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing but a memory.

See also “Headaches” Migraine

Although migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they most frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system, circulates, and affects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta dilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful condition.

FOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET: To treat migraine headaches, it is vital first to take care of pitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. Especially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully following a pitta-soothing diet is effective both for migraine relief and as a preventive measure.

PREVENTIVE BREAKFAST: Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside later in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it into pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of cardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a headache from arising.

HERBAL REMEDY: The following herbal compound will be beneficial:

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Migraine Headaches

For migraine headaches, a mixture of shatavari, brahmi, jatamamsi, and musta can be prepared. Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner with lukewarm water. This formula helps pacify aggravated pitta and relieve migraine headaches.

Avoid direct sun exposure as it can worsen migraine headaches due to increased pitta. Wear a hat if going out in the sun. To relieve headache pain, put warm brahmi ghee drops in each nostril. Recommended yoga postures include Moon Salutation, Hidden Lotus, Boat pose, Bow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. Practice cooling pranayama like shitali and perform a healing yawn by gently squeezing earlobes and yawning.

## Morning Sickness

During early pregnancy, morning sickness characterized by nausea and vomiting is common, especially among pitta individuals. It is due to pitta aggravation and typically occurs between the sixth and tenth week of pregnancy. The rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy triggers pitta in the stomach, leading to increased acid secretion and acidity, particularly in the morning on an empty stomach.

Refer to the "Headaches" section for detailed analysis of vata, pitta, and kapha headaches and their treatments.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Morning Sickness

During pregnancy, morning sickness can be triggered by certain odors, with sensitivity to smell being greatest in the morning. According to Ayurveda, the earth element is prominent during pregnancy, responsible for solidity and structure, and associated with the sense of smell.

## Tips to Manage Morning Sickness:

Start the Day with a Little Food: Have a light meal upon waking up, such as crackers with a slightly salty taste or fresh lime juice with a little salt and sugar to reduce pitta.

Eat Often: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to prevent excess acid secretion on an empty stomach.

Coconut Water: Mix lemon juice with coconut water and sip every 15 minutes to settle the stomach.

Effective Herbal Remedy: Try a mixture of shatavari, shanka bhasma, and kama dudha to reduce acid secretion and relieve nausea.

Almonds: Soak raw almonds overnight, peel off the skin, and eat them in the morning for protein, calcium, and stomach settling benefits.

Walk It Off: Walking in fresh morning air can help reduce pitta, relieve stress, and prevent morning sickness caused by unresolved anger and stress buildup.

By following these Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle tips, you can effectively manage morning sickness during pregnancy.

## Minimassage

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame oil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunflower oil (for kaphas), and rub it over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then take a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called abhyanga) will minimize stress and help with morning sickness.

## Milk with Rose Water

Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling nauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. You can also use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk. This will help to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk with a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning sickness.

## Drink a Lot

Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to compensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons sugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2 hours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.

## Peacock Feather Ash

This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite effective. Ayurvedic literature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash. Burn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the burning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the pregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey. This can immediately stop morning sickness.

## Effective Herbal Formula

No matter what your constitutional type is, this formula will be beneficial for you:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Kama dudha ⅛ part
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Moti bhasma ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with ghee. Or, if you don’t want to use ghee, use warm water. Sometimes during pregnancy women may not feel like taking ghee.

## Muscle Cramps and Spasms

While running, walking, riding a bicycle, standing up for a long time, doing yoga stretches incorrectly, or even sleeping, a person can get muscle cramps. Any muscle—upper arm, forearm, leg, calf, or even a toe or the baby finger—can undergo sudden spasm.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Muscle Cramps and Spasms

Muscle cramps and spasms can have various causes, such as insufficient blood supply, excess blood supply (as in "writer's cramp"), lack of calcium in the diet, malabsorption of calcium, hypoparathyroidism, exposure to cold, and poor circulation.

In Ayurveda, muscle spasms are primarily caused by vata dosha. Increased vata, due to mobile, cold, or rough qualities, can make muscles stiff and hard, leading to spasms.

## Immediate Relief Remedies:

- Grab hold of the muscle.
- Press your index finger deeply into the central part of the muscle for 15 to 20 seconds to stimulate a marma point and help the muscle relax.
- Take a few deep breaths to increase circulation and relax the muscle.

## Pressure Point Remedy:

Locate the marma point at the midpoint of your lips. Grabbing the upper lip for upper body spasms and the lower lip for lower body spasms can help relax the muscles. Apply pressure for 30 seconds.

## Contract and Relax the Muscle:

Alternate between contracting and relaxing the muscle to improve circulation and release lactic acid, which aids in muscle relaxation.

## Massage:

Apply a little oil (such as Mahanarayan oil or sesame oil) to the muscle belly and gently massage to relax the muscle fibers, improve circulation, and pacify vata dosha. Applying heat after massage can further help in relieving the spasm.

During the vata season, especially in winter, individuals prone to vata imbalances may experience muscle cramps due to exposure to cold. Rubbing the muscle with oil and applying heat can be soothing and healing.

## Preventing and Treating Muscle Cramps

Soak It: For a cramp in your foot, soak the foot in a bucket of warm water that contains salt (1 or 2 tablespoons).

Herbal Relaxants: Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, jatamamsi tea, or comfrey tea. You can also make a tea using equal amounts of all three herbs (⅓ teaspoon of each per cup) to relax your muscles.

Prevention: Drink dashamoola tea as a preventive measure against future cramping. Steep ½ teaspoon of dashamoola powder in 1 cup of hot water and have a cup or two every Saturday.

Mineral Supplements: Take calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements to address repeated muscle cramps. The formula should contain approximately 1,200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, and 60 mg zinc, taken at bedtime. Improve absorption by taking triphala every night or in the early morning.

Yogaraj Guggulu: Yogaraj guggulu tablets (200 mg per tablet), taken 2 or 3 times a day for 1 month, are effective for pacifying vata in the muscles, the root cause of muscle cramps.

## Effective Home Treatment for Abdominal Cramps

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may be related. Abdominal cramps can have various causes such as eating a large meal or straining the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach, constipation, or acid indigestion can also lead to cramps in the stomach or abdomen.

- Herbal Compound Shankavati: Take one 200-mg tablet after dinner for painful cramps in the abdominal muscles.
- Antacid Formula: Mix shatavari ½ teaspoon, guduchi ¼ teaspoon, and shanka bhasma pinch. Take this once or twice a day after meals.

## Stuffy Nose Remedies

Placing a few drops of mild eucalyptus oil in the nose can help clear congestion. Note: Dilute eucalyptus oil with sesame oil or another mild oil to avoid skin irritation.

Chop up an onion and inhale its fragrance to benefit from its decongestant properties due to ammonia content. The tears induced by onions can help lubricate the nasal passage and eliminate crust.

Lubricate the nostrils by using brahmi ghee or a saline solution. A simple saline solution can be made by mixing ⅛ teaspoon of salt in ½ cup of water.

Consuming spicy foods like hot soup or vegetables seasoned with cayenne pepper, curry powder, or chili pepper can help increase circulation and clear nasal congestion.

Using a humidifier at night can create a warm and moist environment, aiding in relieving nasal congestion.

## Vitamins and Herbs

Consider taking Vitamin C (1,000 mg twice a day), Amalaki (1 teaspoon in warm water at bedtime), Zinc (60 mg), and Sitopaladi churna (½ to 1 teaspoon with honey and ghee) to support nasal health.

## Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can have various causes such as excess acid secretion, toxins in the liver, pregnancy, colon worms, or food poisoning. Vomiting can be a protective response to eliminate toxins from the body.

In cases of excess bile or food poisoning, vomiting is a natural way for the body to expel harmful substances. It is a sign of the body taking care of itself.

# Vomit for Healing

# Vomit for Healing

Most people find vomiting a rather unpleasant experience, but there are times when one might want to induce vomiting. When someone has a flu or a bad cold, excess kapha may build up and the person suffers from persistent headache, congestion, and coughing. Mother Nature may bring on vomiting to remove the kapha, but if that doesn’t happen, Ayurveda suggests taking matters into your own hands.

Drink a glass of water with ¼ teaspoon salt dissolved in it. The salty water itself is emetic (provokes vomiting), but you can also rub the back of the tongue to stimulate the “gag” reflex and vomit out the water. The moment vomiting occurs, fever will generally come down, the headache will disappear, congestion in the chest will be greatly relieved, and you will feel much better.

## For Nausea in Children

Try giving the child some coconut water. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut), and have the child take a sip every 15 minutes or so to settle the stomach.

## For Worms

Nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of worms. If a person has a history of passing worms in the stool and gets repeated attacks of nausea and vomiting, use the following strategy:

- Take the herb vidanga, about ½ teaspoon twice a day with a little warm water.
- Keep the colon clean by taking ½ teaspoon triphala at night for several weeks. Mix the triphala into ½ cup of warm water, let it steep for 10 minutes, then strain and drink.

## To Detoxify the Liver

Nausea and vomiting may be a sign that there are excess toxins in the liver. To detoxify the liver, the following formula is effective:

- kutki ¼ teaspoon
- shatavari ½ teaspoon
- shanka bhasma pinch
- kama dudha pinch

Take this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water to relieve nausea and vomiting.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Nightmares in Children

The main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based on frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. To treat nightmares in children:

- Avoid feeding the child’s imagination with disturbing images.
- Engage children in creative play and avoid violent or horrifying TV programs or stories.
- Create a pleasant environment in the child's room with sweet music and tinkling bells.
- Tell positive and uplifting stories to children.
- Give the child a mini-oil massage before bed using brahmi oil or bhringaraj oil.

## Remedies for Adults and Children

Tranquillity Tea:

- Ingredients: jatamamsi, brahmi, ginkgo, yashti madhu (licorice root).
- Instructions: Make a tea from equal proportions of the above ingredients. Drink a cup before bedtime for a peaceful mind and body.
- Alternative: Make a tea of equal amounts of jatamamsi and shanka pushpi.

These remedies are beneficial for both children and adults to promote relaxation and peaceful sleep.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Allergies and Nightmares

# Herbs for Allergies

If allergies are the cause of the nightmares, you can help remedy them with sitopaladi and yashti madhu. Mix them in equal proportions, and take ½ teaspoon of each with honey twice a day. For children, use ¼ teaspoon of each.

## Jatamamsi

If you sew an ounce or two of the herb jatamamsi inside a small silk bag and place it under the pillow, its fragrance will help create a tranquil night.

## Nasya

Doing nasya will help. Put 2 to 3 drops of warm ghee or any Ayurvedic nose drops (such as brahmi ghee) in each nostril, and inhale. Nasya is equally effective for children.

## Are Your Dreams Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?

To eliminate nightmares, it can be helpful to know if they are the result of a doshic imbalance of kapha, pitta, or vata, so that the imbalance can be corrected. By analyzing the nature and content of the dreams, it is usually possible to find out.

### Vata Dreams

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the dreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping, flying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued, being locked up—these are vata dreams.

### Pitta Dreams

Pitta dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as teaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta dreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.

### Kapha Dreams

Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water figures prominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus flowers, swans, and elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning, or seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.

## Eat Early

Eat dinner before seven o’clock. Eating too late at night may create nightmares.

## Cut Down on Stress

Yoga asanas, regular exercise, Alternate Nostril pranayama, and meditation morning and evening help to relax the nervous system and reduce stress.

## Crystals

Wearing crystals, or putting some amethyst crystals on the four corners of the bed, may also help. You can tell your child, “Look, I’ve put these crystals around your bed; it will keep the ghosts and monsters away.” They will feel comfortable and will sleep well.

The root cause of nightmares is wrong thinking: negative imagination, loneliness, isolation, fear, disturbed relationships. That is why prayer, positive thinking, positive.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, dry, light, and irregular. Governs movement in the body.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, light, and oily. Governs digestion and metabolism.

To stop nosebleeds, try using pomegranate nose drops by placing a few drops of fresh pomegranate juice in your nostrils. If the bleeding persists, consult a doctor as it could indicate an underlying health issue like high blood pressure or leukemia.

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet by avoiding hot and spicy foods, alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive sun exposure.

### Obesity

Obesity is a condition of excessive body fat accumulation that can lead to various health problems. It is primarily a Kapha disorder caused by overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and lack of exercise.

Factors contributing to obesity include hereditary issues, pregnancy weight gain, stress-induced eating, and certain medications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Obesity

Obesity is often caused by eating too much and not getting enough exercise. Factors such as consuming cold drinks, fatty fried foods, dairy products like cheese and ice cream, and excess sugar and carbohydrates can contribute to obesity.

## Watch Your Diet

Control what you eat by following a kapha-pacifying diet. Avoid cold drinks, fatty fried foods, and minimize dairy products. Include salads, beans, and drink hot water or herbal teas like ginger, mint, or cinnamon. Limit meat consumption to fish or chicken once a month.

## Get Adequate Exercise

Engage in regular exercise such as daily walks, aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming, and weight lifting with 5-pound weights. Remember that burning more calories than you consume is essential for weight loss.

## Post-Exercise Prescription

Avoid cold drinks and snacks after exercise. Opt for hot drinks like herbal teas to maintain a healthy metabolism.

## Eat Your Biggest Meal Early in the Day

Skip breakfast if possible, have a substantial meal at noon, and keep supper light. Avoid snacking between meals and consider skipping supper entirely.

## Listen to Music

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more, so that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.

## Learn to Love Yourself

Most obese people do not love themselves. There is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body; love is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, they may try to find love through eating, and food becomes a substitute for love.

Obese people also hate how they look, which can lead to emotional eating. To develop more love for yourself, try looking at yourself in the mirror and appreciating your own unique qualities.

Stop judging, comparing, and criticizing yourself. Embrace your uniqueness and divine nature as a step towards self-love.

## Time to See the Doctor

If you are very heavy, have not exercised for a long time, and are over 40, consult your doctor before starting an exercise program more strenuous than walking.

## Drink Hot Water and Honey

Whenever you feel hungry, drink a cup of hot water with 1 teaspoon of honey and 10 drops of lime juice added. This can be a good substitute for snacking.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Osteoporosis

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources to prevent osteoporosis. Some sources of calcium include sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow’s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut. Calcium supplements from oyster shells can also be helpful. The daily dose should include about 1,200 mg of calcium, along with 600 mg of magnesium and 60 mg of zinc for maximum absorption and effectiveness.

Almond milk is also a good source of calcium. You can make almond milk by soaking ten almonds overnight in water, peeling them in the morning, blending them with a cup of warm milk, and adding ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink this mixture twice a day, before breakfast and before bedtime.

Chewing a handful of white sesame seeds in the morning provides natural calcium without the risk of clogged arteries. This can help prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women.

It is important to combine calcium intake with physical exercise to be effective in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga exercises should be done gently and with care if osteoporosis has begun to develop to avoid the risk of bone fractures.

Herbal remedies can also help make up for estrogen in the metabolic cycle. A formula containing shatavari, vidari, and wild yam can be beneficial. Adding shanka bhasma and kama dudha to the formula provides a natural source of calcium bicarbonate, which can further prevent osteoporosis. Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm milk as a daily maintenance dose.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid overeating to prevent osteoporosis. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in maintaining bone health.

## Test Your Hunger

When you are hungry, here is one way to find out whether it is an emotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or mint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you will feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won’t diminish your appetite.

## For Hyperthyroidism

If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic disorder, Ayurveda suggests using kaishore guggulu. This herbal compound helps to regulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.

## Drink Brahmi Milk

When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with ½ teaspoon of brahmi will help you control overeating.

## If You Have Already Eaten Too Much

Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a pinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.

Another aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which you have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking soda, stir, and drink quickly.

## Types of PMS

Premenstrual syndrome or PMS is classified in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta, and kapha.

- Vata type is characterized by low backache, lower abdominal pain, distention, anxiety, fear, insomnia, and mood swings.
- Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, urethritis, hives, hot flashes, irritability, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.
- Kapha-type PMS involves water retention (breasts become enlarged and tender) and drowsiness, so that the woman loves to drink coffee!

PMS can be cared for successfully using the following Ayurvedic remedies and...

## For All Body Types

Warm ghee nose drops (5 drops in each nostril) stimulate natural hormones and help regulate balance of the system.

When there is abdominal bloating and cramps, all constitutional types can put a warm castor oil pack on the lower abdomen. One of the qualities of castor oil is that it produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of castor oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other soft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth. Place this compress on the lower abdomen. If you have a hot water bottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. An electric heating pad is not recommended.

NOTE: A warm castor oil pack will also help relieve the congestion and discomfort of endometriosis.

## For Prevention

Be sure to get regular exercise during the month, including half an hour of walking or other aerobic exercise at least five days a week. Yoga stretching is also helpful. However, Ayurveda recommends no exercise or yoga during the actual menstrual period. As much as possible, rest, read, and relax!

To maintain health and balance, follow the dietary guidelines for your constitutional type (see chapter 8).

## Premature Ejaculation

For the man who repeatedly ejaculates prematurely, sex can become a nightmare. He may run away from his partner out of fear that his sexual performance is inadequate, causing serious difficulties in the relationship.

Premature ejaculation is primarily caused by aggravated vata. Vata, with its qualities of quickness and heightened sensitivity to the sense of touch (as pitta brings greater sensitivity to light), gives a predisposition toward faster ejaculation; in general, persons with a vata constitution cannot sustain sex for very long. When vata is unduly increased in a vata individual, premature ejaculation is common.

A psychological, emotional factor of nervousness, fear, or anxiety may also be involved, but this too is due largely to the aggravated vata dosha. Thus the main avenue of treatment is to balance vata dosha.

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

# Premature Ejaculation Remedies

Another possible cause of premature ejaculation is high cholesterol (and the related situation, high triglycerides). In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the blood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels become thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis and prostate is insufficient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature ejaculation.

## Effective Ways to Deal with Premature Ejaculation:

1. Massage the Penis: Do a gentle massage of the penis using a mixture of sesame oil and mustard oil. This will improve blood circulation to the penis. Remember to wash the penis thoroughly before intercourse to avoid any discomfort.
2. Medicated Ghees: Certain medicated ghees like brahmi ghee, shatavari ghee, or ashwagandha ghee can be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before intercourse.
3. Practice: Stimulate the organ up to the point of ejaculation without ejaculating. Practice Ashwini Mudra to raise energy and train the organ to be ready but not ejaculate. This exercise should be done 1 to 2 hours before intercourse.
4. Control Muscles: Learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.
5. Marma Point: Locate the marma point at the center of the glans penis and gently press it while sucking the anus inward. This improves blood supply to the penis and helps maintain the erection.
6. Yoga Postures: Helpful yoga asanas include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated Lotus, and Vajrasana.
7. Diet Suggestions: Follow a vata-soothing diet if you have premature ejaculation. For high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. Keep sugar intake low if you have diabetes.

It's important to address premature ejaculation with a holistic approach that includes physical exercises, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Effective Herbs

Make an herbal formula, mixing equal amounts of the following herbs:

- Ashwagandha
- Bala
- Vidari

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t find goat’s milk, but goat’s milk is more effective.

Ginseng is also helpful. It has properties similar to the Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha. Take ½ teaspoon after lunch and dinner with warm goat’s milk. Cow’s milk is acceptable if you can’t locate fresh goat’s milk.

## Almond Milk

Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel off the skin, put the almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow’s milk and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron (Saffron is a mild aphrodisiac). Drink almond milk every morning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.

## Heal the Prostate

Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as prostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage the area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame oil is also beneficial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First rub in a circular motion, then finish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Don’t press hard; use light strokes.

### Prostate Problems

In middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become enlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may wake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have difficulty urinating, so that it may take some moments for the flow to start, or the flow may be slow, or it may “dribble” at the end. He may find that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly, or that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty completely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the bladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.

Another problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is characterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.

### Herbal Remedies

A number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.

## Herbal Formula:

Make a formula using the following Ayurvedic herbs:

- Punarnava - 2 parts
- Shilajit - ⅛ part
- Gokshura - 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of the mixture twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water. Continue until symptoms resolve.

## Teas for Relief:

You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea for relief. Follow the directions on the package or use bulk herbs by adding about 1 teaspoon of mixture to a cup of boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, cool, and drink.

## Time to See the Doctor:

If prostate cancer is a possible diagnosis, consult a medical professional. For benign causes, consider the following remedies:

- Cumin-coriander-fennel tea: Mix equal amounts, steep 1 teaspoon in hot water for 5-10 minutes, and drink 2-3 times a day.
- Punarnava guggulu: Take 1 tablet twice a day.
- Mixture of Vidari and Ashwagandha: Take ½ teaspoon 2-3 times a day with warm water.

## Other Helpful Remedies:

Oil Massage: Apply castor oil or sesame oil to the perineum area with gentle circular motions towards the base of the penis.

Yoga Tradition: Perform Ashwini Mudra by pulling the anus inward in tense-release movements. Do 10 repetitions morning and evening. Kukutasana pose can also be beneficial for prostate problems.

# Rashes and Hives

# Rashes and Hives

Skin rashes and hives indicate excess pitta or heat in the body; the Ayurvedic approach is to provide a cooling effect from both the inside and outside.

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

Whatever the cause of the rash, whether allergies, an insect bite, or something else, cilantro juice will be immediately effective. Wash fresh cilantro, chop it into pieces, put it into the blender, add ⅓ cup of water, and blend. Drink the juice, and apply the pulp directly onto the skin.

## TOPICAL SOLUTIONS

The following remedies applied directly to the skin will help soothe and heal rashes and hives:

- If you have a fresh coconut, break it open and apply the coconut water to the rash.
- Melon can also be soothing to rashes and hives. Eat some melon, and rub the remaining rind (not the outer tough skin) over your skin. With watermelon, eat the red part and rub the white part of the rind onto your skin.
- For rashes, hives, and other high-pitta conditions such as nausea, steep 1 teaspoon coriander, ½ teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon natural sugar in 1 cup hot milk. Drink once or twice a day.
- You can also use a paste made of sandalwood and turmeric powders mixed in goat’s milk. This paste is healing for the skin. The formula is simple:
- Turmeric 1 part
- Sandalwood powder 2 parts

Mix up about a teaspoon of powder in this proportion, add sufficient goat’s milk to make a paste, and apply it to the affected area. Cow’s milk is acceptable, but goat’s milk is more effective. PLEASE NOTE: Your skin will look yellow for some time—up to 3 or 4 days—after you use the paste.

## FOR INTERNAL HEALING

Here is an effective formula to help restore health to your skin from the inside:

- Coriander 2 parts
- Cumin 1 part
- Raw natural sugar 2 parts

Steep ½ teaspoon of this mixture in a cup of hot milk, and drink it once or twice a day until the condition is healed.

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

# Rectal Bleeding Remedies

Numerous factors can give rise to rectal bleeding. These include hemorrhoids; inflammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal fissures or polyps; passing dry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to constipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive heart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor exerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also common among people who eat refined foods containing little fiber. Eating hot spicy food may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.

## Recommendations:

- Wash with Cool Water: After each bowel movement, wash the anal orifice with cool water. This will help stop the bleeding and minimize irritation, itching, and cracking.
- Apply Ghee or Castor Oil: Soothe the irritation of the blood vessels.
- Drink Cranberry Juice or Pomegranate Juice: These are hemostatics that stop bleeding. Drink 1 cup twice a day.

Time to See the Doctor: If the remedies do not stop rectal bleeding in a week to 10 days, consult a doctor, especially if the bleeding is profuse. It could be a symptom of a serious illness.

Avoid Hot Spicy Food: Follow a pitta-pacifying diet and avoid fermented food, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.

Keep the Stools Soft: Ways to keep stools soft include drinking warm milk with ghee at bedtime, taking amalaki or triphala in warm water, and using psyllium husks in warm water at night.

Use Vitamin K: For serious bleeding, take vitamin K supplements or use vitamin K cream to stop the bleeding.

Pacify Pitta: Reduce pitta by taking vitamin E supplements and drinking cranberry juice and/or parsley juice.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Preventive Measures for Rectal Bleeding

To avoid rectal bleeding in the future, follow these recommendations:

- Strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid sour fruit, citrus fruit, fermented food, or hot spicy food.
- Avoid hard physical labor if possible.
- Do abdominal yoga exercises such as nauli.
- Practice yoga postures like Camel, Cobra, Cow, and Spinal Twist to improve elimination.
- Take the herbal formula consisting of shatavari, kama dudha, and gulwel sattva twice a day for 1 month.

## Rectal Itching

Rectal itching can have various causes including worms, parasites, hemorrhoids, ulcers, yeast infection, fungal infection, or excess toxicity in the colon.

### For Worms

If worms are the issue, use the herbal formula of vidanga, shardunika, and trikatu twice a day after meals.

Additionally, take triphala every night in warm water.

### For Yeast Infection

If there is a yeast infection, apply yogurt to the anal orifice and wash the anus with water.

### For Hemorrhoids

If hemorrhoids are the problem, take a baking soda bath and apply neem oil to the affected area.

#  Ayurvedic Home Remedies

Be sparing with soap. As a general rule, it is beneficial to use soap on your skin only once or twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people sweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have to take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much sweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.

Of course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and sweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important not to wash off the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we apply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.

... (Additional content truncated for brevity) ...
Gentle towel massage. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your face and body. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look young.

##  Home Face-lift

You can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle pressure from the chin to the forehead.

##  Face-lift Massage

Put your two index fingers together, and your two thumbs. Place the two index fingers between your lower lip and your chin, and the two thumbs just under the chin. Then, pressing lightly with your index fingers, sweep along the jawbone.

## Facial Muscle Tone Improvement

To improve facial muscle tone and reduce wrinkles, gently massage the area behind the temple with your thumbs in a lifting motion for about 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure seven times daily, preferably in the morning.

## Fresh Cherry Mask

Apply a pulp of fresh cherries to your face as a mask before bedtime. Leave it on for 15 minutes to relieve dry skin and enhance your complexion.

## Smile for Skin Health

Maintaining a smile on your face can help keep your facial muscles toned and skin youthful, making you appear younger than your age.

## Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition characterized by brief interruptions in breathing during deep sleep, often accompanied by loud snoring and abnormal breathing patterns. It can lead to exhaustion, strain on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and other health issues.

### Ayurvedic Treatment for Sleep Apnea

In Ayurveda, sleep apnea is attributed to excess kapha blocking prana vata. Treatment involves controlling kapha levels in the body.

### Remedies to Control Kapha

- Take ¼ teaspoon of pippali with 1 teaspoon of honey and ghee on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.
- Alternatively, use trikatu churna (a mix of pippali, black pepper, and ginger) as a substitute.
- For decongestion, consume ½ teaspoon of sitopaladi with ¼ teaspoon of yashti madhu in 1 teaspoon of honey twice a day.

## Sleep Apnea in Premature Babies

Sleep apnea can also affect premature babies, and similar Ayurvedic remedies can be applied to address the condition in infants.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Premature infants sometimes have sleep apnea due to immature respiratory centers. This can lead to breathing pauses and even turning blue or purple. Quick actions like tickling the soles of the feet or sprinkling cool water on the belly can help the baby start breathing again.

## Prevention and Remedies

- Nasya: Instill 5 drops of warm brahmi ghee or plain ghee in each nostril in the morning and before bed.
- Obesity: Address obesity with a herbal formula including kutki, chitrak, and shilajit. Regular exercise, like walking, can also improve breathing.
- Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions, especially sleeping on the left side for obese individuals.
- Humidify the House: Maintain a warm, humid atmosphere at home to prevent dry air-induced apnea.
- Panchakarma: Consider panchakarma purification therapy under Ayurvedic supervision, involving oil massage, purgation therapy, and nasal administration of medications.

It's important to seek medical care for serious conditions like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) associated with sleep apnea. As the baby's respiratory center matures, sleep apnea should improve.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Smoking Addiction

# Smoking Addiction Remedies

Addiction to smoking has two main causes: nicotine toxicity and stress. Once a person becomes a smoker, he or she has to achieve just the “right” amount of nicotine toxicity to maintain proper functioning of the brain as well as normal digestion and elimination. Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually reach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine toxicity and dealing with the stress.

## Herbal Cigarette

To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests preparing a herbal mixture containing brahmi, jatamamsi, and rose petal powder. Replace a portion of the tobacco in your cigarettes with this mixture to help reduce stress levels and detoxify your body.

## Overwhelm Yourself

Place a few drops of brahmi ghee directly on the cigarette before lighting up. The strong smoke produced can help eliminate the desire to smoke.

## Effective Herbal Tea

Instead of smoking during times of stress, prepare and drink a herbal tea made of jatamamsi, chamomile, and brahmi. Steep the mixture in hot water and sip slowly to help relieve the desire to smoke.

## Chew Instead of Smoking

When the desire for a cigarette arises, chew small pieces of dried pineapple mixed with honey as an alternative.

## Reduce Stress by Meditating

Manage stress by meditating daily. Practicing yoga postures, such as the Moon Salutation sequence, can also be helpful in reducing the desire to smoke.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Introduction to Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through a holistic approach to health and wellness.

## The Doshas

Ayurveda recognizes three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

## Illnesses and Remedies

### Sore Throat

A sore throat is caused by irritation and inflammation of the throat. Ayurvedic remedies include:

- Gargle: Mix 1 cup of hot water with ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt for gargling morning and evening.
- Turmeric Milk: Drink 1 cup of hot milk boiled with ½ teaspoon turmeric.
- Soothing Herbal Tea: Prepare a ginger-cinnamon-licorice tea mixture and drink up to 3 times a day.

If the sore throat persists, it is advisable to consult a medical professional. Avoid dairy products and fermented foods, except for warm turmeric milk. Yoga postures like the Lion pose and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Bhramari, can also help alleviate a sore throat.

### Yoga and Breathing Exercises

Yoga poses like the Locust pose, Bow, Shoulder Stand, Plow, Palm Tree, Lion pose, and Yoga Mudra, along with breathing exercises like Breath of Fire and Humming Breath (Bhramari), can aid in various health conditions including smoking cessation and sore throat.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Spastic Colon

For help with spastic colon, you can use the remedies suggested under “Irritable Bowel Syndrome.” In addition, try the following Ayurvedic herbal formula:

- shatavari 4 parts
- hingwastak churna ⅛ part
- ajwan ¼ part
- chitrak 1 part

Take about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water, after meals.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sprains and Strains

Stepping off the curb in a wrong way, losing your balance when walking (especially easy to do when you wear high-heeled shoes), falling on an outstretched hand—all of these can lead to a sudden twisting of an ankle, wrist, or hip joint, resulting in a sprain or strain.

Although sprains and strains are similar, there is a difference. A sprain affects ligaments and is a pitta condition. It is caused by excessive stretching or even tearing of the ligament and involves pain, swelling, and blackish-bluish discoloration. A strain affects muscle, is due to vata, and does not produce bruise discoloration, although there is pain.

Wrap It Up: Whenever there is a strain or sprain, as soon as possible wrap the area in an elastic bandage.

Drink Some Juice: Then drink some pineapple or pomegranate juice. These juices contain an enzyme that acts as an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory. This helps to pacify pitta and accelerates the healing process.

Soak It: For ankle sprain, soak your foot in a pot of hot water with a homemade mustard seed tea bag. Make the bag by tying up 2 teaspoons of brown mustard seeds in a handkerchief, some cheesecloth, or other light cloth. Immerse the bag in the hot water.

To relieve the swelling, soak the foot for 15 minutes in hot water with 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.

Apply a Healing Paste: Make a paste out of ½ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt, with enough water to form the paste. Use cool water. Applying it to the injury will help reduce swelling.

If it is a strain rather than a sprain, use a hot paste of turmeric and salt to help pacify.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Characterized by qualities of cold, light, dry, and irregular. Imbalance can lead to issues like joint pain and digestive problems.
- Pitta: Characterized by qualities of hot, sharp, and intense. Imbalance can manifest as inflammation and skin issues.
- Kapha: Characterized by qualities of heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold. Imbalance may result in respiratory issues and weight gain.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Stomachache

Stomachache can have various causes including acid stomach, indigestion, constipation, and liver toxicity. It is important to rule out serious conditions like appendicitis before treating a common tummy ache.

#### Herbal Remedies

- Mix together cumin powder, hing (asafetida), and rock salt. Chew well and wash down with warm water.
- For stomachache with diarrhea, apply fresh ginger juice around the belly button.

- For indigestion, consume fresh onion juice with honey and black pepper.

Remember to consult a physician for severe stomach issues and consider these natural remedies for mild stomach discomfort.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Two Herbal Teas

Make some cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Mix the three herbs in equal proportions, and use ½ teaspoon per cup of water. Drink 2 to 3 times a day to help soothe an aching stomach.

Another simple tea can be made of equal amounts of the common Western herbs angelica, chamomile, and comfrey. Mix them together, and steep about ½ teaspoon of the mix in hot water.

## The Master Key to Prevent Stomachache

Most of the time, a stomachache is due to indigestion and low agni (digestive fire). Here are four ways you can kindle agni:

- One of the best herbs to strengthen digestive fire is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and eat the mixture. Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.
- Ginger tea will also increase the gastric fire and reduce the stomachache. Boil a little fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea, and drink it 2 or 3 times a day.
- Draksha (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive fire. Use 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port or another sweet wine.
- Another simple way to enliven your gastric fire is to use the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.

## Additional Remedies and Recommendations

EAT LIGHTLY. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and heavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice and dal that is easy to digest. (See this page for a basic kitchari recipe). Between meals, take some fruit juice.

FOR CHRONIC INDIGESTION. For chronic poor digestion and frequent stomachaches, prepare this herbal mixture:

- trikatu 1 part
- chitrak 2 parts
- kutki 1 part

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Strengthening Digestive Fire

Take ¼ teaspoon before meals, with a little honey and fresh ginger juice. If you don’t have fresh ginger, just use honey. This mixture will help strengthen the digestive fire.

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

### Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

### Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

### Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

## Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

## Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.

## Monitor Your Negative Thinking

Stress is often the result of fear that is based largely on imagination. Look at your negative thinking, and replace it with positive thinking. Just changing your thinking or your attitude can alleviate much stress.

## Examine Your Role and Your Goal

Find the right match between your job and your personality. Job stress can be a burden when work and personality are not appropriately matched. Discover your true role and goal to reduce stress.

## Soothing Bath

A ginger-baking soda bath can be quite soothing. Add ⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.

## Oils for Relaxation

Rub a little brahmi oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at bedtime. You can also use pure castor oil for a calming effect by applying it to the soles of your feet and eyes.

## Medicated Nose Drops

Try nasya with brahmi ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee into each nostril for relief. Refer to the nasya instructions for proper usage.

## Stress-Reducing Tea

Prepare a relaxing tea using herbs like chamomile, comfrey, angelica, or brahmi. These teas can help manage stress when consumed 2-3 times a day.

## Yoga Stretching

Practice specific asanas like Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose for stress management. The Lion pose is also effective in relieving stress.

## Meditation

Sit in the Lotus pose or Easy pose, facing east, and meditate. Focus on your breath or try the So-Hum meditation for stress relief.

## Breathe Away Stress

Practice Ujjayi pranayama for calming effects. You can do this breathing exercise sitting up or lying down in Savasana for stress relief.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Sunburn

Here are some ayurvedic home remedies for treating sunburn:

- Take a gauze pad, dip it into cool milk (cow’s milk or goat’s milk), and apply it directly to the sunburn. If milk is not available, use a cloth dipped in cool water.
- Apply tikta ghrita (bitter ghee) topically.
- Pulverize some lettuce and apply the pulp directly to the sunburn.
- Place an icebag or a bag of frozen food on the affected area to cool the skin. Do not leave ice touching your skin for more than a minute or two without a break.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, and natural remedies.

## The Three Doshas

In Ayurveda, the three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own set of characteristics:

- Vata: Associated with air and space, Vata governs movement and is linked to dryness, coldness, and lightness.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta governs digestion and metabolism. It is associated with heat, intensity, and sharpness.
- Kapha: Governed by earth and water, Kapha provides structure and stability. It is linked to heaviness, slowness, and steadiness.

## A-Z Illness and Remedies

### Anemia

If swelling is due to anemia, particularly folic acid or iron deficiency anemia, addressing the missing nutrients can help reduce or eliminate the swelling. Tests can determine the specific deficiencies. Recommendations include dietary changes and supplements.

### Protein Deficiency

Lack of protein may also contribute to swelling. Increasing protein intake, such as through soy products, can help alleviate this issue.

### Additional Recommendations to Relieve Edema

- Exercise: Regular walking can improve circulation and reduce swelling.
- Avoid Salt: Limiting salt intake can help prevent water retention and swelling.
- Raise Your Feet: Elevating your feet with a pillow while lying down can aid in reducing swelling.

### Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care

According to Ayurveda, teeth are related to bone health. Dental issues like cavities and receding gums may indicate vata aggravation in the skeletal system.

For mineral deficiency related to teeth problems, incorporating calcium-rich foods and mineral supplements can be beneficial. Massaging gums with sesame oil and using herbal tooth cleansers are also recommended practices for oral health.

#### Herbal Tooth Cleanser

Ayurvedic dentistry suggests using bitter and astringent herbs like neem, lohdra, kushta, and bilva for tooth cleaning. Mixing powdered neem with astringent herbs can create a natural tooth cleanser. Commercial toothpastes with these herbs are also available.

## Teeth and Gum Care

You may find powders for the teeth made out of finely ground, roasted almond shells which are beneficial for maintaining good dental health.

Using Tea Tree Oil for Receding Gums and Sensitive Teeth:

- To treat bacterial infection in the roots of the teeth causing receding gums and sensitivity, brush teeth with tea tree oil and apply to gums.
- Applying tea tree oil to dental floss can help reach deep pockets of infection.

Chew Well: Chewing food well not only aids digestion but also stimulates the gums.

Try Figs: Eating and chewing figs daily can help strengthen teeth and gums.

Tap Your Teeth: Gently tapping teeth together can stimulate energy meridians related to dental health.

## Tendinitis Relief

Tendinitis can result from strenuous sports or repetitive non-strenuous activities. Here are some remedies:

For Mild Conditions:

- Apply a cold compress to minimize inflammation.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Gentle Stretching

Careful, gentle stretching of the affected muscles will gradually help to improve circulation and heal the pain and inflammation.

## Take Anti-Inflammatory Herbs

Taking some anti-inflammatory herbs will accelerate healing. Make this formula:

- kaishore guggulu 2 parts
- manjistha 2 parts
- musta 2 parts

Take ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water after meals.

## For Acute or Chronic Conditions

Apply Heat: For both acute tendinitis and chronic tendinitis, apply soothing heat such as a liniment or a warm water compress to minimize pain or inflammation.

Oil Massage: Gently massage the affected area with mahanarayan oil and soak it in warm water.

## Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ears)

Herbal Remedies: According to Ayurveda, ringing in the ear is a vata disorder. To alleviate this root cause, prepare a tea made from equal amounts of comfrey, cinnamon, and chamomile. Drink 2 or 3 times a day.

- Take yogaraj guggulu (200 mg. 2 or 3 times a day) with warm water after food.
- Gently rub the mastoid bone with warm sesame oil twice a day for a week.
- Place 3 drops of garlic oil into your ear at night before bed.

Refer to the appendix for more information on preparing oils like garlic oil.

# Toenail Infection

# Toenail Infection

When persons who have thick, tough toenails cut their nails in a convex curve, as the nails grow the edges may start to penetrate the skin and cut the soft tissue. This may lead to inflammation, swelling, pain, and possible infection. Generally, the nails of vata and kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes that are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail infection.

The long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-moon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of into the skin at the sides.

If the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil mixed half and half with neem oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.

To prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight across or in a shallow half-moon shape.

# Toothache

See also “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care”, “Gum Disease”

Toothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity, and/or infection.

If high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid indigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-soothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented foods (see chapter 8).

When the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may become exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to cold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)

For any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the site of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind, which is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth. The saliva will mix with the camphor and will relieve the toothache. (See appendix 2 for directions on making medicated oils.)

Don’t just settle for getting rid of the pain, however. If you have a cavity, be sure to get it taken care of. And to avoid future problems, follow the recommendations for healthy teeth and gums in the section entitled, “Teeth and Gums—Ayurvedic Care.”

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Ulcers

# Ulcers in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract are a pitta disorder. Pitta is hot, sharp, and penetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft tissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can develop ulceration because of excess pitta.

## Causes and Symptoms

Individuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and Rh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. Symptoms of ulcers include pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.

## Main Principle for Treatment

The main principle for treating ulcers is to pacify pitta. Follow a pitta-pacifying diet, avoid hot spicy food, fermented or sour food, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. Avoid aspirins or steroids that can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.

## Herbal Formulas

An effective herbal treatment for ulcers includes the following formula:

- Shatavari 5 parts
- Yashti madhu 3 parts
- Shanka bhasma ⅛ part
- Kama dudha ⅛ part

Take ½ teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a little warm water. Additionally, taking 1 teaspoon of sat isabgol (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm milk can be beneficial.

## Stress Reduction

Stress is often a cause or complicating factor in ulcers. To dissolve stress, prepare Tranquillity Tea from herbs like jatamamsi, brahmi, and shanka pushpi. Steep about ½ teaspoon of the mixture in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour before going to bed.

## Yoga Postures

Yoga asanas can help relax and relieve stress, benefiting ulcers. Recommended positions include Leg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist. Refer to illustrations of yoga postures in appendix 4 for guidance.

## Chapter 6: Breathing Exercises for Stress Relief

Shitali pranayama, a breathing exercise with a cooling effect, can help alleviate stress. Moon breathing, which involves breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes can also have a cooling effect. Detailed breathing exercises can be found in chapter 6.

## Healthy Eating Habits for Ulcers

It is recommended to eat early in the evening and have small meals, especially for individuals with ulcers. Avoid eating late at night and opt for small, frequent meals to prevent keeping the stomach empty for long periods. Regular meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner help utilize stomach acid for digestion.

## Herbal Acid Blocker for Ulcers

An effective herbal acid blocker in Ayurveda consists of brahmi, jatamamsi, and yashti madhu in equal proportions. A tea made from ½ teaspoon of these herbs per cup of water, taken after lunch and dinner, can help inhibit acid secretions and prevent ulceration.

## Urinary Incontinence and Ayurveda

Urinary incontinence, primarily a vata disorder, is caused by weakness in the bladder muscles, particularly the bladder sphincter. This condition can be managed with herbs, oil enemas, and specific yoga exercises. Women are more prone to urinary incontinence due to their shorter urethra.

### Yoga Exercise: Ashwini Mudra

Ashwini mudra involves using the perineal muscles to tighten the anus inward and strengthen the gluteal muscles, aiding in bladder sphincter control.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on balancing the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

- Vata: Associated with air and ether, Vata governs movement and is characterized by qualities like dry, light, cold, and rough.
- Pitta: Linked to fire and water, Pitta controls digestion and metabolism, with qualities such as hot, sharp, light, and oily.
- Kapha: Tied to water and earth, Kapha regulates structure and lubrication, exhibiting qualities like heavy, slow, steady, solid, and cold.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

### Urinary Incontinence

Urinary incontinence is often a result of excess Vata. Remedies include:

- Perform pelvic floor exercises regularly.
- Practice specific yoga postures like Vajrasana, Forward Bend, Shoulder Stand, and Plow pose.
- Take a mixture of ashwagandha, bala, and vidari twice a day.
- Consume white sesame seeds daily with jaggery or brown sugar.
- Try a sesame oil enema weekly to balance Vata.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can worsen incontinence.
- Follow a Vata-pacifying diet to help manage urinary incontinence.

### Yeast Infections

Yeast infections are a mix of Pitta and Kapha disorder. Remedies include:

- Follow a diet that does not aggravate Pitta or Kapha.
- Avoid sugar, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.
- Choose foods that soothe Pitta and do not provoke Kapha.

# Effective Herbal Remedy for Yeast Infection

A potent herbal formula that will help to heal a yeast infection:

- Turmeric ¼ teaspoon
- Licorice ½ teaspoon
- Shardunika ¼ teaspoon

Take this complete mixture (1 teaspoon of herbs) twice a day with warm water until your symptoms are gone.

## Douche for Vaginal Yeast Infection

If the yeast infection is vaginal, you will find it helpful to douche with licorice tea. Follow these steps:

1. Boil 1 tablespoon of licorice powder in 1 pint of water for 5 minutes.

NOTE: If you have a thick discharge from the genitals, along with an itching and burning sensation, it will be better to do the douche with triphala tea instead of licorice. Use the same procedure: take 1 tablespoon of triphala, boil it in a pint of water, cool, strain, and use the tea as a douche.

Taking Responsibility for Your Own Health: How to Integrate Ayurveda into Your Life

Ayurveda is a comprehensive approach to health that encompasses all facets of our life and living. Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the external environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and spiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical Ayurvedic texts.

From our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the purpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat? How much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the five-thousand-year-old living tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.

As a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it certainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health and healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its principles into action. Just to run to the remedies section (Part III) when you have a health problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete science of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.

I would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is totally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as understanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that from what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may decide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that may be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen overnight.

On the other hand, I would also not be telling the truth if I didn’t say that every small step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive effect on your body, mind, and consciousness.

To incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people find it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type. Then gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily routine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of the suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.

The underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal himself or herself. We each have the ability and the freedom to recover our health if we

Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health and well-being that focuses on maintaining vitality and joy of living. By understanding our body, its needs, and the ever-changing environment, we can address health conditions and maintain balance.

## Understanding the Body

Consciousness plays a key role in Ayurveda, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of our body's signals and needs.

## Body's Language

Health conditions are the body's way of communicating imbalance. Symptoms like headaches, fever, or joint pain indicate doshic imbalance, which can be addressed through balancing vata-pitta-kapha.

## Restoring Balance

Ayurveda teaches us to restore balance by recognizing doshic imbalances and harmonizing vikruti (current state) with prakruti (original constitution).

## Healing through Balance

Creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, as well as vata-pitta-kapha, is essential for healing and total health.

## Shared Responsibility

Health and healing require shared responsibility between the physician and the patient. By following Ayurvedic principles, you become both the healer and the one receiving healing.

Use this knowledge to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.

# Appendix 1: How to Use the Healing Properties of Metals, Gemstones, Colors, and Aromas

Ayurveda teaches that everything in existence is imbued with the energy and intelligence of Universal Consciousness. Matter is the trapped light of consciousness, and the vital force of life flows from the universal source. The classic texts of Ayurveda emphasize that all substances in nature contain cosmic creative intelligence and have healing value when used properly.

## Metals

For medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in small doses after purification. Copper, for example, alleviates excess kapha, reduces fat, and is beneficial for the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. To treat obesity and liver or spleen disorders, copper water can be prepared by boiling copper pennies in water and consuming 2 teaspoons three times a day for a month.

## Gemstones

Gemstones also possess unique energies that can be utilized for healing. Each gemstone is associated with specific properties that can balance doshas and promote well-being. For example, wearing a ruby can enhance vitality and energy levels, while emerald is known for its calming effects on the mind.

## Colors

Colors play a significant role in Ayurvedic healing. Different colors are linked to the three doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can pacify vata dosha, while cool colors like blue and green can balance pitta dosha. Using color therapy in daily life can help maintain doshic balance.

## Aromas

Aromas or essential oils have therapeutic properties that can influence physical and emotional well-being. Inhaling lavender oil, for example, can promote relaxation and reduce stress, while peppermint oil may aid digestion and boost mental clarity. Aromatherapy is a powerful tool in Ayurveda for maintaining health.

GOLD

Gold is strengthening to the nervous system and the heart, improves memory and intelligence, and increases stamina. It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful for students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.

The energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure gold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil until 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize the heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t hurt your gold.)

You can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice pot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.

NOTE: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals with a pitta constitution.

SILVER

Silver has cooling properties and is beneficial for treating excess pitta. Silver increases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation, chronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inflammatory conditions of the intestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is antiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above directions for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk heated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.

IRON

This metal is beneficial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases the production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle and nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and pans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it. Although women during their menstruating years may be iron-deficient and may benefit from additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron. An exception might be longtime strict vegetarians.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies - Gems and Stones

# Gems and Stones in Ayurveda

Gems and precious stones contain healing energies that can be activated by wearing them as ornaments, such as rings or necklaces, or by placing them in water overnight and drinking the water the following day. Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the body (the chakras) and have a direct influence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be used to pacify or activate specific organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the effects of particular planets in the person’s astrological birth chart.

## Important Points about Gems and Stones:

- Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is beneficial to purify any stone before using it by soaking it for two days in saltwater or milk.
- When wearing a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the setting to interact directly with the body's energies.
- Location of wearing the stone is important. Recommendations include diamond on the ring finger, pearl on the little finger, red coral on the ring finger, etc.
- Ayurveda generally recommends rings to be worn on the right hand.
- Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. Authentic, unprocessed stones without flaws are preferred.
- Stones should ideally be 3 to 5 karats in size for optimal effect.
- Consult an expert before investing in a stone, especially if you are not knowledgeable in Vedic astrology.

## Characteristics of Main Gems and Stones:

Here are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones:

- Diamond: Ring finger
- Pearl: Little finger
- Red Coral: Ring finger
- Emerald: Little finger
- Opal: Ring finger
- Yellow Sapphire: Index finger
- Blue Sapphire: Middle finger

# Ayurvedic Gemstones and their Benefits

# Ayurvedic Gemstones and their Benefits

## Ruby

Astrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes longevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem strengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart. Rubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as rubies; they are the poor man’s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on the ring finger, or in a necklace.

## Pearl

As rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling effect and a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their cooling action is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity. Pearl ash is used internally to effectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the strengthening effects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of water; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.

## Yellow Sapphire

This precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and wisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities. It strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should always be worn on the index finger, the finger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man’s sapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.

## Blue Sapphire

This beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the benefits of that very spiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire calms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal system and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle finger, preferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.

## Lapis Lazuli

This stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to the body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual vibrations. It strengthens the eyes, calms vata and pitta, and is helpful for anxiety, fear, and weakness of the heart. It is also good for the liver and for skin diseases. Lapis should be set in gold and worn on the little finger, or worn as a necklace.

## Emerald

This powerful precious stone brings prosperity and spiritual awakening. It calms vata and pitta, settles the nervous system, and relieves nervousness. Symbolic of the planet Mercury, emeralds improve writing skills, enhance the power of speech, and promote intelligence. They are best set in gold and worn on the little finger.

## Diamond

This very powerful gemstone combats premature aging, enhances the span of life, and strengthens immunity. Its energy brings subtle energy vibrations to the heart, brain, and deeper bodily tissues. It is the best stone for rejuvenation. It brings prosperity and is spiritually uplifting.

The doshic effects of diamonds vary according to their color. Red diamonds have a fiery energy that stimulates pitta; blue diamonds are cooling and calm pitta while increasing kapha. Clear, colorless diamonds calm pitta but increase both vata and kapha.

Symbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in relationships and are rightfully associated with marriage. These stones stimulate shukra, the body’s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this stone. Wear your diamond set in gold, either as a necklace or as a ring on the ring finger. But note: Diamonds of low quality may have negative effects upon the body.

## Red Coral

This gemstone from the sea represents the planet Mars. It calms pitta and helps one to control anger, hatred, and jealousy. Coral gives energy to the liver, spleen, and pericardium. Wear your red coral as a necklace or as a ring set in copper (preferably), silver, or white gold and worn on the ring finger. Red coral is strength-giving and imparts gracefulness.

## Opal

This semiprecious stone represents the planet Neptune. It strengthens majja dhatu (bone marrow and nerves) as well as shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue). It improves vision, relieves fever, calms pitta, and is good for migraine headaches. Opals enhance spiritual feelings, increase devotion, and help to unfold intuition. This gem is particularly beneficial for individuals with Neptune in their third, fourth, sixth, tenth, or twelfth astrological house. It should be set in gold or silver and worn on the ring finger.

## Cat’s-Eye

This stone is good for allergies, repeated colds and congestion, and allergic asthma. It pacifies kapha and vata while slightly increasing pitta. It aids in healing kidney dysfunction. Cat’s-eye enhances awareness and helps a person not get caught up in emotions. People working in psychological healing should wear this stone in a gold setting on their ring or little finger; it will help protect them from negative influences.

## Quartz Crystals

These stones have a Venus-like vibratory energy that is somewhat like that of diamonds. They calm vata, improve the quality of perception, strengthen communication, and enhance intuition. You can wear quartz crystals as a necklace, or set in either silver or gold and worn on the ring finger.

## Onyx

This stone is excellent for vata disorders. It is good for old age, debilitating disorders, and neurological dysfunction, and it helps with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and even schizophrenia. It induces quiet, deep sleep yet combats lethargy. It is good for memory and promotes positive thinking. Onyx makes life peaceful and happy and enhances love in relationships. It has energy vibrations that are Sun-like and Jupiter-like. This stone should be set in silver and worn on the ring finger. (If your Sun sign is in Sagittarius or Gemini, it is better not to wear this stone.)

## Jade

Jade is beneficial for longevity. It strengthens kidney energy and is reputed to bestow success upon its wearer. This stone is also good for the power of speech. It helps to prevent cataracts and is strengthening for the prostate. Wear a jade ring set in silver, on your little finger.

## Amethyst

Amethyst is a stone for the crown chakra and is good for mental clarity. To bring prosperity, it should be set in gold. You can also wear it around the neck on a gold necklace. A person with neuromuscular weakness can be helped by wearing amethysts and by putting them at the four corners of the bed. Some amethysts have a darker color, which gives them a Saturn-like energy similar to blue sapphire. Amethysts bestow dignity, love, compassion, and hope. This gem helps the individual to control emotions and is good for vata and pitta imbalance.

Aquamarine is a gemstone that symbolizes Mercury and possesses qualities that promote happiness, intelligence, and improved memory. It is recommended for married couples to enhance love in their relationship. Aquamarine should be set in silver and worn on the little finger.

## Four Inexpensive Stones to Help Balance the Doshas

For balancing Vata dosha, rose quartz can be used. Red coral or pearls are recommended for Pitta dosha, while garnets can help balance Kapha dosha. These stones have specific properties that aid in balancing the respective doshas.

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on achieving balance in the body through diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices.

## The Doshas and Their Characteristics

In Ayurveda, there are three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own unique characteristics and governs different functions in the body.

### Vata Dosha

Vata is associated with the elements of air and ether. It governs movement and is responsible for functions such as breathing, circulation, and elimination.

### Pitta Dosha

Pitta is associated with the elements of fire and water. It governs digestion and metabolism and is responsible for functions such as digestion, absorption, and temperature regulation.

### Kapha Dosha

Kapha is associated with the elements of earth and water. It governs structure and lubrication and is responsible for functions such as strength, stability, and immunity.

## A-Z Illness and Their Remedies

There are various illnesses that can be treated using Ayurvedic remedies. Each illness is approached holistically, taking into account the individual's dosha constitution and overall health.

### Red

Red is a warming and stimulating color. It can relieve aggravated Vata and reduce excess Kapha. However, overexposure to red may aggravate Pitta and lead to inflammatory ailments. Red stimulates the formation of red blood cells, improves circulation, and gives energy to nerve tissue and bone marrow.

### Orange

Orange is a warming color with healing energy. It is sexually stimulating and provides energy to the sex organs. Orange is balancing to Vata and Kapha but may aggravate Pitta. It has antibacterial properties and hinders the growth of bacteria.

### Yellow

Yellow relieves excess Vata and Kapha. It promotes understanding, intelligence, and spiritual realization. Yellow acts as a decongestant and antibacterial. Overexposure to yellow may increase Pitta dosha.

### Green

Green has a calming effect on the mind and body, creating a feeling of...

## About Ayurveda

Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India. It focuses on the balance of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - in the body to maintain health and prevent illness.

## The Three Doshas

The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is associated with air and ether, Pitta with fire and water, and Kapha with earth and water. Each dosha has its own characteristics and influences different aspects of our physical and mental well-being.

## Colors and Doshas

Colors play a significant role in Ayurveda and can have an impact on our doshic balance. Different colors have varying effects on the doshas:

### Green

Green is soothing to the emotions and brings energy to the heart chakra. It is calming for excess Pitta but may aggravate Vata and Kapha. Green helps in healing ulcers and promoting the growth of granulation tissue.

### Blue

Blue is a cooling color that relieves aggravated Pitta. It has a calming effect on the body and mind, correcting liver disorders. Placing a baby with jaundice under a blue light can aid in faster healing. Overexposure to blue may aggravate Vata and Kapha.

### Purple

Purple is associated with Cosmic Consciousness and enhances awareness. It relieves excess Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata.

### Gold and Silver

Gold, a warming color, is beneficial for Vata and Kapha. Each constitutional type has specific colors that are soothing and balancing:

#### Vata

Vata types should minimize dark and cooling colors and opt for warm pastels, sunny yellows, and greens. Warming reds and oranges can also be beneficial.

#### Pitta

Cool, soft colors like blues and purples are best for Pitta types. Silver and blue-greens are also recommended, while reds and oranges should be avoided.

#### Kapha

Bright, lively colors such as red, yellow, orange, and gold are good for balancing Kapha. Dark blues, greens, and whites should be minimized.

# Aromas and Ayurveda

Every human being has five senses, which are associated with the five elements. Aromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from flowers, plants, trees, and grasses to bring healing energy to mind and body through the olfactory sense. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to doshic balance and imbalance.

## Aromas and Doshas

- Vata: Balanced by sweet, warming, grounding aromas like musk, hina, and camphor. Other good fragrances for vata include orange, clove, cardamom, lavender, pine, angelica, and frankincense.
- Pitta: Soothed by cooling, calming, sweet aromas such as sandalwood, khus, jasmine, and rose. Rose geranium, lemongrass, fennel, peppermint, gardenia, and mint may also be beneficial.
- Kapha: Pacified and balanced by aromas with a warming, somewhat stimulating effect like musk, hina, and camphor. Pungent aromas such as eucalyptus, cinnamon, myrrh, thyme, basil, rosemary, and sage are also helpful for kapha.

Each aroma has specific effects on the doshas, and it's important to choose the right fragrances based on your doshic constitution for optimal healing benefits.

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

# Appendix 2: How to Prepare and Use Herbs, Ghees, and Oils

This appendix briefly explains the preparation of herbs and special remedies such as medicated oils and ghees and offers suggestions on their use. For a complete description of herbs and their uses, as well as thorough directions for the preparation of herbal remedies, please refer to The Yoga of Herbs by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. David Frawley (see Reading List).

## Herbal Mixtures

### USE WHOLE HERBS AND FOODS

Ayurveda believes strongly in the use of whole herbs, foods, and plants. Isolated active ingredients or chemically produced analogues are not equivalent to natural whole food sources. For sources of herbs, see Resources.

### HOW MUCH TO PREPARE

If you are going to be taking an herbal mixture for several days, weeks, or even months, to save time you will probably want to prepare a fairly large quantity. Then each time you use it, take ¼ to ½ teaspoon unless otherwise directed.

In this book, formulas for herbal mixtures are given in “parts” rather than in milligrams or teaspoons. For example, a formula may call for:

- herb 1 - 2 parts
- herb 2 - 3 parts
- herb 3 - ¼ part

Choose your own measure according to how much you want to make. If, for example, you are measuring in teaspoons, you will use:

- 2 teaspoons of herb 1
- 3 teaspoons of herb 2
- ¼ teaspoon of herb 3

If you are making a large batch for long-term use, you can measure in tablespoons. A 1- to 2-month supply will require 2.5 to 5.0 ounces of herbs, a palm-size quantity. Again,

## Where to Obtain Herbs

Most of the herbs mentioned in this book can be obtained in bulk or capsules at a good natural foods store. It is recommended to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special Ayurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the suppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.

## How to Take Herbs

Herbs are usually taken with a vehicle or medium (anupana) to aid absorption by the body and carry the quality of the herbs to the specific tissue or site of the disease. Common vehicles used in Ayurveda include water, milk, honey, aloe vera, and ghee. The choice of vehicle depends on the herb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors. Recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is suggested, warm water is recommended. Avoid using capsules if possible, but if needed, you can fill empty vege-capsules with the herbal mixture.

## Using Triphala

Triphala, meaning "the three fruits," is a beneficial remedy made of three important Ayurvedic herbs: amalaki, bibhitaki, and haritaki. Each herb works on a specific dosha. Triphala is rejuvenative and strengthening for all three doshas and all seven dhatus. It balances ojas, tejas, and prana, and also acts as a mild laxative. To take triphala, mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of triphala powder in boiling water, steep for 10 minutes, and drink after your evening meal. The taste may be bitter at first, but regular use can lead to improved health and a more tolerable taste.
---
# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Triphala Usage

Triphala can be taken in various ways:

1. Place ½ to 1 teaspoon of dry triphala powder on your tongue, and wash it down with warm water.
2. For some people, triphala acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at night. If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in about one hour.
3. If you dislike the taste, mix the triphala powder with honey and take it that way.

# Ghee Preparation

How to Make Ghee:

Two pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and unsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium, and heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn it.

Turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this temperature. Do not cover the pot to boil the water out and separate the solids. Stir occasionally until the ghee turns a lovely golden color.

When whitish curds form and turn a light tan color, and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Remove it from the heat immediately to prevent burning. Let it cool until warm, then decant the clear ghee into a container, discarding the curds at the bottom.

# Storing Ghee

Ghee can be kept on the kitchen shelf without refrigeration. Its medicinal properties are said to improve with age. Avoid using a wet spoon or allowing water into the container to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.

# Effects of Ghee

Ghee is known for its beneficial effects and can be a valuable addition to your diet.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

## Ghee Benefits and Usage

Ghee increases digestive fire and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes ojas, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous system, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body more flexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven dhatus. It pacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.

NOTE: People who have high cholesterol or who suffer from obesity should be cautious about using ghee.

## How to Make Medicated Ghees

Ghee is a highly effective anupana (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include shatavari ghee, brahmi ghee, tikta ghrita (bitter ghee), triphala ghee, and many others.

The process of making medicated ghees is quite lengthy. If you wish to make it yourself, follow these steps:

1. First, make the ghee as described above.
2. Next, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts of water.
3. Boil the herbs slowly over a low flame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount.
4. Strain out the herbs after several hours of cooking.
5. Mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low flame until all the water evaporates.

## Medicated Oils

Medicated oils such as amla oil, brahmi oil, bhringaraj oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others are made similarly to medicated ghees, but using oil instead of ghee in the final stage.

## Neem Oil

Neem oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking neem leaves in a base of sesame or another oil. It is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.

## How Long to Take a Remedy

When using ayurvedic remedies, it is important to follow the recommended duration for each remedy to experience its full benefits.

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

# Ayurvedic Home Remedies

The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear. This may take from a few days to a few months, depending on the severity of the disease or condition, how long you have had it, how motivated you are to get well, and other factors.

In addition to taking your remedies, please also look into the underlying causes of your condition. You may need to rethink your diet, daily routine, exercise program, and so on. Simply taking herbal remedies, without making some changes in your lifestyle, will probably not be sufficient to override the behavior patterns that caused your illness in the first place.

So use your common sense. If the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that something that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month. On the other hand, if your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make appropriate lifestyle changes, and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor for help.

# Appendix 3: Special Ayurvedic Procedures

This brief appendix offers guidelines on some of the Ayurvedic procedures recommended throughout Part III.

## Basti (Ayurvedic Enema)

Ayurvedic enema treatment (basti) introduces into the rectum medicinals such as sesame oil, or herbal decoctions such as dashamoola, in a liquid medium. Medicated enemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal distension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various nervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that basti is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. Basti also is effective for treating chronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other conditions.

NOTE: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suffering from diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse edema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged, and children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas. Oil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis, heart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.

The best times for basti are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty, so wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and comfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an enema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove, the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.

The usual procedure for basti is first to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame oil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil, introduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The mixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint) of tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body temperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is dashamoola, which is particularly effective for balancing vata.

To introduce the fluid into the rectum, first fill the enema bag, which should be suspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube, and close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the floor on your left side, your left (bottom)

## Enema (Basti)

To perform an enema, lie on your left side with your left leg extended and your right leg flexed at the knee. Lubricate the syringe tip with oil or ghee, insert it into the rectum, and release the clip to allow the fluid to enter. Hold the fluid for 10 minutes, then assume a hands-and-knees position to relax the colon. Massage the colon area lightly in a counterclockwise motion. Sit on the toilet to release the fluid and fecal matter afterward.

## Nasya

Nasya is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or fine powders. When self-administering nasya, dip your clean finger into the recommended oil or ghee, and gently massage the inside of your nostril before sniffing to draw the oil upward.
